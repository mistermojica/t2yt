do you remember the promise that Jesus

made before he went up to heaven he told

us that he would send the Holy Spirit to

be with us in John 14 verse 16 he said

and I will pray the father and he will

give you another helper that he may

abide with you forever

Jesus promised us a Helper and today I

want to encourage you to take hold of

this promise and welcome the Holy Spirit

into your life Welcome him into every

part of your day

each day presents an opportunity to walk

with the spirit

allowing him to lead guide and shape

your life according to God's perfect

plan interestingly

have you ever thought about how you

usually start your day

apart from those who starts their day

with prayer

it may be very different for some of us

or some you may stumble out of bed

blurry-eyed reaching for the alarm to

Grant you just a few more precious

minutes of sleep you may fumble around

in the room a bit brewing coffee maybe

catching a few minutes of the Morning

News preparing for the day ahead while

for others the way you start your day

may be quite different you may gradually

turn your arms sliding out from under

the covers you make a careful deliberate

movement your hand is searching for The

Familiar cool hard surface of your phone

resting on the nightstand as you bring

it closer your thumb swipes the screen

and you begin to check for any messages

or updates

the quiet hum of the morning is

interrupted only by the occasional chime

or Buzz of notifications and so your day

begins but in these moments we may

Overlook something of vital importance

we may neglect an opportunity a gift

that could fundamentally change how we

experience our day

that gift is the Holy Spirit you can

invite the Holy Spirit to be your

constant companion knowing that he is

faithful to be with you and to work in

and through you for God's glory so you

might be thinking what does it really

mean to start your day with the Holy

Spirit

it's not as simple as pouring a cup of

coffee or lacing up your shoes

no starting your day with the Holy

Spirit is so much more than that it is

the conscious decision to invite God

through his spirit to guide Inspire and

walk with you in all you do

it is the desire to not just live but to

live in communion with our creator

allowing him to lead us in his perfect

wisdom and love in Acts 8 verses 29 to

30 the Bible says the spirit told Philip

go to that Chariot and stay near it

then Philip ran up to the Chariot and

heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet

do you understand what you are reading

Philip asked in these verses

Philip one of Jesus's disciples is told

by the Holy Spirit to go near a chariot

there's a man in the Chariot reading the

words of Isaiah a prophet from the Old

Testament part of the Bible because the

Holy Spirit told Philip to go to The

Chariot he was able to help the man

understand the words of Isaiah

this shows us how the Holy Spirit can

guide us to be in the right place at the

right time

just like Philip when we start our day

with the Holy Spirit we can get access

to God's leading and God's wisdom this

is a good reason why we need to pray

every morning

and ask the Holy Spirit to be with us as

we go about our day

let us also consider the Apostle Peter

in Acts 10 Peter was praying on the

rooftop when he had a vision that led

him to a profound understanding of God's

unconditional love

God through his Spirit spoke to Peter

guiding him

teaching him and preparing him for the

works he had planned at times you may

think that these stories seem distant or

they only happen in the Bible

but that's not true

the same holy spirit that guided Philip

and Peter is the same Holy Spirit

available to each of us every morning

the same God Who provided strength and

wisdom is there for us at the start of

each new day

our challenges might be different but we

all face our struggles

it may be a Health crisis financial

difficulties or personal struggles that

threaten to consume us

but here's the profound truth when we

start our day with the Holy Spirit we're

not facing these trials alone as Paul

assured us in Romans 8 verse 31

if God is for us who can be against us

so how do we invite the Holy Spirit into

our mornings

starts with a simple invitation

in The Quiet Moments before the day

sweeps you away

take a moment to welcome God into your

day it doesn't require eloquent words or

elaborate prayers

a heartfelt holy spirit guide me today

is more than enough let the Bible be

your morning nourishment

as you feed your body and feed your

spirit

let the word of God be the first thing

that you consume each day as we are

reminded in Deuteronomy 8 verse 3.

man does not live by bread alone

but man lives by every word that comes

from the mouth of the Lord

inviting the Holy Spirit into your

mornings is a Daily Commitment

it's a journey filled with growth

Discovery and transformation

there may be days when it feels

difficult

days when you might question if the holy

spirit is truly with you but remember

the Holy Spirit isn't based on feelings

but on God's promise

he's there with you guiding you

even when you may not sense him and as

you begin your day with the Holy Spirit

anticipate the transformation that will

take place

you will experience peace amidst chaos

strength and weakness and Clarity and

confusion Beyond these blessings you

will develop a relationship with God

that is deeper and more intimate than

anything this world can offer so let us

embrace the spiritual practice not just

today but every day beginning each day

with god with his holy spirit in second

Corinthians 13

verse 14 the Bible encourages us saying

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

the love of God

and the communion of the Holy Spirit be

with you all

now to all those within the sound of my

voice
