put God first in your life and

everything will fall into

place everything today God wants you to

put him first we're also going to pray a

powerful prayer with you calling on God

to bless you abundantly in the name of

Jesus so watch until the end and open

your heart to receive the blessings of

this prayer in Matthew

6:33 the Bible tells us but seek first

the kingdom of God and his righteousness

and all these things shall be added to

you now imagine you're at the heart of a

busy City surrounded by towering

skyscrapers and The NeverEnding hum of

life yet in the midst of this Whirlwind

of activity you find an oasis of calm a

place where time seems to slow down and

peace Reigns Supreme this is what life

feels like when we put God first in the

middle of our chaotic lives amidst the

many roles we play and the countless

challenges we face when we Center our

lives around God we discover an

extraordinary peace a profound sense of

purpose and a Divine direction that

guides us this is the

journey we are about to Embark upon

today a journey of putting God God first

and reaping the manifold blessings that

follow there is a fundamental

truth one that resonates deeply within

our hearts influencing every decision

and action we

make I am talking about the profound

realization that it's absolutely

essential to make God the main focus of

our lives our life is shaped by the

things we decide are most

important just like when we choose to

stop and and watch the sunrise hurry to

finish our tasks or spend time with

loved ones each of these choices shows

what we value most in the same way we

choose a place for God in our lives so

we have to ask ourselves have we given

God the first place which is where he

should be or has he gotten lost in the

mix of all the other things we have to

do think about how everything in nature

works together perfectly

the planets move around the Sun in a

specific pattern the seasons change one

after the other showing the beauty of

nature even our bodies work in a certain

way with our hearts beating and our

lungs breathing in and out this shows

that everything has its own place and

role just like these God too has a

special place in our lives he should be

at the very center most important part

of our Lives when we make sure God is at

the center Our Lives become beautifully

balanced like a well-played song the

story of how the world began in the

Bible shows us how important God is

Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God

created the heavens and the Earth God

made everything come alive just by

speaking the land the sky the sea and

all the animals came to be because God

wanted them to and we who are made to be

like him carry some of his greatness

just like everything else in the

universe Our Lives should also revolve

around God God takes priority over

everything else when we put God first it

fills us with peace purpose and joy yet

in the hustle and bustle of Our

Lives it's all too easy to lose sight of

God's rightful place

we get entangled in the complexities of

our worldly lives often forgetting our

divine origin some of us may be tempted

to ask why should we put God first isn't

it enough to be kind and compassionate

and to live a Godly life however in

Exodus

20:3 the Bible makes it clear when God

gave us the first commandment you shall

have no other gods before me when God

says this it's not out of a Divine need

for validation but out of a deep

parental love he knows that our true

fulfillment comes from making him our

priority placing others or other things

above God means we are letting them take

his rightful place in our lives whether

we recognize it or not so someone might

say this is from the Old Testament we

don't need to do this today well

although in different words Jesus

expressed similar sentiments in the New

Testament in Matthew 22: 37-38 the

scripture tells us Jesus said to him you

shall love the Lord your God with all

your heart with all your soul and with

all your

mind this is the first and great

commandment so here Jesus is validating

that the first commandment still stands

this verse means we should put God first

in our lives just like this Old

Testament verse tells us you shall have

no other gods before me loving God

wholeheartedly means placing him Above

All

Else some of us prioritize our jobs

While others put family members like

wives husbands children or parents ahead

of God for

some God might even be at last place

while for others God God might not have

any place in their lives at all but

today we'll shift our Focus today we

will rightfully position God at the

Forefront of Our Lives putting him above

everything and everyone else when we

don't Place God first it can lead to

many

challenges sometimes we even end up

fighting unnecessary battles today I

urge you to put God first don't we all

benefit when we place God in his

rightful place it's a

win-win everyone wins when we put God

first we become better

wives better husbands better human

beings we become better in every area of

Our Lives Guided by God's counsel and

wisdom God's Commandments aren't meant

to control us they're there to help us

live our best lives his first

commandment there for isn't a burden but

an invitation an invitation to align our

lives with his Divine wisdom by putting

God first we allow his infinite love and

wisdom to guide our

lives this brings about a profound

transformation one that fills our lives

with hope and love now let's talk more

about what happens when we place God at

the center of our lives when we decide

to put God first in our

lives we embark on a journey that brings

forth blessings beyond our imagination

did you know that God will actually

bless you more than you expected yes

Ephesians 3: 20 to 21 tells

us now to him who is able to do

exceedingly abundantly above all that we

ask or think according to the power that

works in US to him be glory in the

church by Christ Jesus to all

generations forever and ever amen note

that the scripture says above all that

we ask or think that's talking about

blessings beyond our imagination the

first blessing is that of divine

guidance when we prioritize God we

invite his wisdom into our lives we move

forward under his guidance

secure in the knowledge that our steps

are ordered by him as stated in Proverbs

3:

5-6 trust in the Lord with all your

heart and lean not on your own

understanding in all your ways

acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your

paths this means that when we put God

first we will never be lost God will

guide us in the right direction the

Second Blessing is one of Peace amid

life storms when we prioritize God an

unexplainable Tranquility surrounds us

this peace stems from knowing that God

is in control and that he works all

things together for our good this piece

as Philippians 4:7 describes it

surpasses all understanding will guard

your hearts and Minds through Christ

Jesus when we put God first he gives us

peace that is beyond our comprehension

the third blessing

comes in the form of divine

provision when God is our priority our

needs do not go

unnoticed he is our provider as stated

in the scripture mentioned earlier in

Matthew

6:33 we are reminded but seek first the

kingdom of God and his righteousness and

all these things shall be added to you

to you the things here refer to our

basic needs which God promises to

provide when we put him first Another

Blessing we receive is protection when

we align our lives with God's will we

come under his Divine protection this

doesn't mean we won't face difficulties

but it assures us that he will be with

us through those

times Psalms 91: 1-2 says he who dwells

in the secret place of the most high

shall abide under the shadow of the

Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my

refuge and my Fortress my God in him I

will trust by putting God first we gain

a protective refuge in him another Bible

verse found in Philippians 4: 19 says

and my God shall supply all your needs

according to his riches in Glory by

Christ Jesus when we place God at the

Forefront we invite his Divine provision

Vision into our lives he ensures that

our needs whether physical emotional or

spiritual are taken care of as we walk

with God we experience his Divine

protection even in the midst of

storms we are secure knowing that he is

our shield and our Fortress and lastly

placing God first in our lives blesses

us with purpose life isn't just a bunch

of random things happening it's like a

beautiful story made by God he has a

plan for each one of us a purpose that

fulfills us and glorifies him Jeremiah

29:1 tells us for I know the plans I

have for you declares the Lord plans to

prosper you and not to harm you plans to

give you hope and a future when God is

at the helm of Our Lives we live with

immense hope and joy prioritizing God

brings numerous blessings of guidance

peace provision protection and purpose

it takes us on a journey filled with his

goodness and

mercy so let's make a conscious decision

today and every day going forward to put

God first and partake in the Bountiful

blessings that he promises to those who

do so understand that when God takes

precedence in our lives we receive his

Divine blessings however when we put God

first in our lives it isn't solely for

the blessings we might receive in return

while God's blessings are cherished

gifts the True Heart of our devotion

goes beyond any tangible or intangible

rewards we put God first because we

truly love him it's like when you do

something nice for a friend not because

you want something back but just because

you care about them in the same way we

love and honor God and that's why we

make him our top priority we put him

first not as a transaction or an

expectation of blessings but as an

expression of our unwavering love and

gratitude for who he is in our lives let

us look again at the story of

Abraham he stands out as a vivid

Testament to this God asked Abraham to

sacrifice his beloved Son Isaac Abraham

was deeply grieved but he chose to obey

God he was willing to give up what was

most precious to him placing God above

even his cherished son the Lord

intervened at the last moment sparing

Isaac and blessing Abraham for his

unwavering Faith his story is a powerful

reminder of the blessings that follow

when we put God first the life of Daniel

is also another story that speaks of the

blessings of prioritizing God Daniel was

a captive in Babylon serving under a

king who did not Worship the Lord yet

Daniel chose to remain faithful to God

even when the king's decree threatened

his life Daniel continued to pray to God

placing him above the king's commands he

was thrown into a lion's den but God

shut the mouths of the Lions and

protected Daniel his story serves as a

Beacon of Hope showing us that when we

stand firm in our faith placing God

first he helps us in the most miraculous

ways how then do we put God first in our

lives the first step is prayer and

worship 1 Thessalonians 5: 16-18 reminds

us rejoice always pray without ceasing

in everything give thanks for this is

the will of God God in Christ Jesus for

you communication is key to any

relationship and our relationship with

God is no exception in prayer we pour

out our hearts to him we speak and we

listen through worship we express our

love and gratitude this daily communion

Fosters a deep personal connection with

God another way to prioritize God Is by

studying his word I have said this

several times the Bible is not merely a

historical

text it's God's Living Word to us it's

his love letter to humanity filled with

his

promises guidance and Revelations about

his nature in Psalm 119 verse

105 the Bible says your word is a lamp

to my feet and a light to my path so

regularly studying the Bible nourishes

our spiritual lives helping us grow in

understanding and Faith

but there are also benefits for our

physical

well-being when we focus on his

teachings as we prioritize him in our

daily lives in today's fast-paced world

stress often feels like a constant

Shadow but spending time in God's word

offers a much needed break from the

chaos it provides Comfort wisdom and

guidance all of which can significantly

reduce our stress levels when our minds

are at peace our

bodies naturally follow suit a decrease

in stress can lead to better sleep a

more robust immune system and an overall

healthier body the scriptures are filled

with teachings that subtly guide us

towards a healthier LIF

style these teachings remind us of the

value of rest the importance of treating

our bodies with respect and the benefits

of living a balanced life when we

internalize these

messages they often manifest as better

physical

habits ensuring our bodies are well

taken care of

also by studying God's word our

decisionmaking

process becomes more informed we're

equipped to make choices that not only

benefit our spiritual self but also our

physical self additionally dedicating

time to understand the scriptures helps

sharpen our minds fostering mental

Clarity and focus in

essence while the spiritual nourishment

from God's word is undeniable its impact

on our physical health is equally

undeniable by aligning our our elves

with God's wisdom both our spirit and

body flourish now obedience to God's

word and guidance is another crucial

aspect of placing God first obedience is

not about Mindless compliance it's about

trusting in his wisdom and love it's

about choosing to follow his guidance

even when the path is challenging

obedience is a testament of our love for

God affirming his rightful place in our

lives

John 14:15 tells us if you love me keep

my Commandments and as we know keeping

the Commandments is all about obedience

that guides us to the best outcomes in

life consider that our

resources time talents and money are all

gifts from God using them in a way that

honors him is another practical way to

place God first this could mean spending

time in service which refers to

volunteering helping out in the

community or doing acts of kindness

without expecting anything in return

it's a way to give back show love and

make a difference in the lives of others

or in the broader Community we could

also consider using our talents to

further his kingdom or contributing

financially to God's work this further

helps to reflect our recognition of

God's lordship over our lives

1 Peter

4: 10 reminds us as each one has

received a gift Minister it to one

another as good stewards of the manifold

grace of God placing God first in our

lives is a conscious decision that we

need to make every day it's not about

convenience but about conviction it's

not about Comfort but about

commitment when when we make this Choice

Our Lives start falling into place

according to his divine plan we may not

have everything we want but we will have

everything we

need for our God is a god of abundance

love and peace so let us make the

conscious decision today and every day

from now on to put God first to Center

our lives around him to let his love

and wisdom guide our thoughts words and

actions let us remember the promise in

Proverbs

3 Verse 6 in all your ways acknowledge

Him and He Shall direct your paths as

you put God first may you experience the

profound peace and joy that come from

living in alignment with his will may

you witness the miraculous unfolding of

his divine plan in your life now to all

those within the sound of my voice let

starting your day with Psalm

121 is like wearing a warm protective

jacket it reminds us that God is is

always there looking out for us no

matter what the day might throw our way

so no matter what you're facing today

God is reminding you your help comes

from the Lord the maker of heaven and

Earth we're also going to pray a

powerful prayer with you calling on God

for divine protection and to bless you

abundantly in the name of Jesus so watch

until the end and open your heart to

receive the blessings of this prayer

each morning when the world awakens to

the fresh Light of a new day we're given

a brand new start similar to how the

ocean waves wipe away yesterday's

footprints on the sand it's clear that

the dawn doesn't just symbolize a new

day it embodies the promise of a fresh

alignment with God now at the core of

our daily renewal is Psalm

121 this special special and comforting

Psalm reminds us that even when the

world feels heavy and challenges seem

too big our God is always looking out

for us ensuring we're safe and protected

it's like God is saying to us you're not

alone I'm right here with you now listen

to this Psalm

121 is often referred to as the traveler

Psalm but why why this particular Psalm

well this is because this Psalm is a

powerful prayer to start your Day's

Journey it is a reminder that no matter

where we

go or what challenges we Face God is

always with us watching over our every

step just as a traveler might face

unexpected twists and turns on a journey

we too encounter unknowns in our daily

lives let's explore this powerful and

impactful Psalm verse by verse which

provides Ides a comforting assurance

that even in the midst of life's

uncertainties we're never truly alone

this Psalm offers us hope strength and a

Guiding Light reminding us of God's

unwavering presence and Care in verse

one the scripture reads I will lift up

my eyes to the hills from whence comes

my help picture yourself in front of a

towering mountain or staring up into the

Limitless Sky it's a humbling moment

isn't it this verse mirrors that feeling

by directing our gaze to the hills it's

like turning our thoughts to something

much larger than our daily concerns God

then this verse has a probing question

where does my help come from this

resonates with times when we're

uncertain or fearful pondering where to

turn for support the beautiful answer is

echoed in verse two but it is also

nicely captured in Psalm

46:1 God is our refuge and strength a

very present help in trouble so when

problems come and we feel alone this

verse reminds us that God is always

there to help us he's not just an

observer he's our everpresent help so I

ask you today where does your help come

from does it come from your job your

salary or income does it come from your

friends or loved ones where does it come

from let's explore the best answer to

these questions in verse two verse 2

says my help comes from the Lord who

made Heaven and Earth it's human nature

to be proud of our Creations be it

something as simple as a meal or as

complex as a painting we craft our days

scheduling every hour with activities

and goals but this verse beckons us to

pause and consider something greater in

all creation the heavens and the

Earth the magnificence of the sparkling

Stars the moon the sun and the beauty of

our world with its varied Landscapes

environments and life all these were

fashioned by the Lord this is the great

God that we serve the God of all

creation in the book of

Exodus chapters 35 to 50 we remember the

story of the

Israelites during their construction of

the Tabernacle in the desert every

worker was filled with the spirit of God

to design and create consider that their

abilities were not solely their own they

were gifts from the Divine Creator

similarly our skills intelligence and

even our capacity to plan our gifts from

God this realization is both humbling

and empower EMP

powering if our daily plans seem great

how much greater is the one who created

the universe by acknowledging that our

true help comes from the creator of

Heaven and Earth we place our trust not

in our limited abilities but in the

boundless power and wisdom of God this

verse in its Simplicity reminds us that

no matter how big our Hills are our

helper is infinitely greater our God is

bigger than our problem

now let's look at verse three he will

not let your foot be moved he who keeps

you will not Slumber each day we wake up

we step into a world full of surprises

and uncertainties some days can feel

like walking on a tight rope with

challenges ready to throw us off balance

but here in this verse there's a

powerful promise God will not let our

foot slip or be moved it's like having

the world's best balance keeper by our

side consider the story of Peter walking

on water in Matthew 14:

22-33 as long as his eyes were fixed on

Jesus he could do the impossible but the

moment he focused on the raging Storm he

began to sink yet even in that instant

of faltering Jesus reached out

immediately ensuring Peter did not drown

God's protective hand is just like that

ensuring that even if we wobble we won't

fall the latter part of the verse paints

a comforting image God never takes a

break from looking after us unlike us

who need rest and sleep God's vigilance

is constant imagine a guardian who never

blinks never tires and never sleeps

that's our God always active ensuring

our safety verse 4 says behold he who

keeps Israel will neither slumber nor

sleep this verse serves as a beautiful

Echo to the previous verse but broadens

the scope while the previous verse might

seem more personal this one extends that

guardianship to the entirety of God's

people by making reference to Israel the

story of the Israelites escape from

Egypt in Exodus 12 to 14 comes to mind

as they were pursued by Pharaoh's Army

with the Red Sea in front of them it

looked like all was lost but God who

never sleeps nor Slumbers made a way for

them parting the Red Sea it wasn't just

about Moses or Aaron but the entire

nation this verse reminds us that God's

attentive care isn't just for

individuals but it is expansive covering

communities Nations and even Generations

his reliability doesn't just extend to

one person person it covers all his

people verse 5 says this the Lord is

your keeper the Lord is your shade on

your right hand the reality is this

mornings bring with them the Rising Sun

casting light but also heat in life too

we often encounter situations that might

be intense or challenging but here's the

promise God acts as a shade offering a

relief a place of comfort amidst the

heat of life's challenges

the story of Jonah in the Book of Jonah

4: 5-8 provides a reflection on this

after delivering God's message to

Nineveh Jonah sat outside the city and

God provided a plant to give him shade

though Jonah's experience was short it

symbolizes the constant protective shade

that God offers to us the mentioning of

the right hand in this verse is also

significant in biblical times the right

hand was a symbol of power Authority and

honor when God is our shade at our right

hand it's not just about protection it's

also about empowerment every task we

undertake every challenge we face has

God's hand of strength and honor guiding

and supporting us it's a reminder that

with God by our side who or what can be

against us now let's move on to verse

six it tells us the son shall not strike

you by day nor the Moon by night let's

face it every day has its highs and lows

much like the sun's blazing Heat and the

Mysterious darkness of the night the sun

can be harsh reminding us of the clear

problems we face during our daily

routines these can be big things like

troubles at

work problems at home or even our own

worries and fears fears on the other

hand the moon though it brings light to

the night often symbolizes the

unknown the challenges that we don't see

coming or those that confuse us remember

the story of the Israelites wandering in

the

desert this can be found in Exodus

13:

21-22 where God guided them with a

pillar of cloud during the day and a

pillar of fire at night night this means

he was with them during both the clear

challenges of the day and the

uncertainties of the night similarly

this verse Comforts us with the promise

that whether our problems are clear as

day or hidden in the shadows of night

God is there providing protection and

guidance God is so good to us verse

seven assures us the Lord will keep you

from all evil he will keep your life

think about starting each day with a

shield around you not just any Shield

but one that can protect you from every

bad thing that might come your

way this verse is like a promise of that

Shield every day there are many

things seen and unseen that can hurt us

but here we are told that God will keep

us safe from all of it the story of Job

might come to mind in the Book of Job

1:1

Satan pointed out that God had put a

protective shield around job his family

and everything he had even in his

intense trials God's protective hand

over job's life was evident

similarly this verse isn't just about

protecting us from physical harm or

challenges it's deeper than that it's a

promise about guarding our very being

our Essence and our life

that means even if we Face problems deep

inside where it matters most we are kept

safe and secure by God it's like having

the best safety promise as we step into

the challenges of each day and the last

verse which is verse 8 tells us the Lord

will keep you going out and you're

coming in from this time forth and

forever more as we know it

life is a series of

Journeys sometimes we step out maybe

it's for work or to face a challenge or

even to embrace a new opportunity other

times we come in seeking rest returning

to our loved ones or reflecting on our

experiences this verse paints a picture

of God's constant care no matter which

direction we're heading it's like having

a protective Friend by our side every

time we step out of our front door and

the same friend welcoming us back home

remember the story of Jacob when he was

fleeing from his brother Esau and

heading to a foreign land in Genesis

28:15 God promised him I am with you and

will keep you wherever you go and will

bring you back to this land even in

unfamiliar territory Jacob wasn't alone

God was watching over is going out and

is coming in likewise this verse from

Psalm

121 assures us of the same thing God's

care isn't just for today or tomorrow

it's forever so whether we're facing a

new day heading into an unknown

Adventure or coming back from a long

journey God's promise remains unbroken

he watches over every step we take from

now till the end of time this thought

offers us a warm blanket of comfort

knowing that in the big story of Our

Lives God's protective hand is always

there looking out for us so as we

journey through the Hills and Valleys of

life we are never truly alone the verses

of Psalm 121 remind us that our steps

are guided our paths are watched and our

lives are surrounded by God steadfast

love and protection whether you're

stepping out into a new challenge or

finding your way back from a long

journey take heart God's promise of care

protection and guidance is

unbreakable remember in the big story of

Our Lives God's protective hand is

always there looking out for us as you

approach today as you step into tomorrow

and all the days

after carry with with you the comforting

Assurance of this powerful Psalm and in

moments of Doubt or fear just lift your

eyes to the hills to the heavens and

know truly know that your help comes

from the Lord the maker of heaven and

Earth be encouraged and keep trusting in

God knowing God is always with you

now to all those within the sound of my

voice let us go to the Lord in prayer I

want you to pray this prayer with me so

that you can have all the blessings of

this prayer let us pray to our gracious

and loving God heavenly father and

blessings peace and positive

transformations in lives near and far

Lord I place all my concerns dreams and

desires into your capable hands let your

will be done in my life thank you Lord

for hearing and answering my prayer in

the name of Jesus Jesus I pray amen do

you remember the promise that Jesus made

before he went up to heaven he told us

that he would send the Holy Spirit to be

with us in John 14 verse 16 he said and

I will pray the father and he will give

you another helper that he may abide

with you forever Jesus promised us a

Helper and today I want to encourage you

to take hold of this promise and welcome

the Holy Spirit into your life Welcome

him into every part of your day each day

presents an opportunity to walk with the

spirit allowing him to lead guide and

shape your life according to God's

perfect plan

interestingly have you ever thought

about how you usually start your day

apart from those who starts their day

with prayer it may be very different for

some of us for some you may stumble out

of bed blurry eyed reaching for the

alarm to Grant you just a few more

precious minutes of sleep you may

thumble around in the room a bit brewing

coffee may be catching a few minutes of

the Morning News preparing for the day

ahead while for others the way you start

your day may be quite different you may

gradually turn your arms sliding out

from under the covers you make a careful

deliberate movement your hand is

searching for The Familiar cool hard

surface of your phone resting on the

nightstand as you bring it closer your

thumb swipes the screen and you begin to

check for any messages or updates the

quiet hum of the morning is interrupted

only by the occasional chime or Buzz of

notifications and so your day begins but

in these moments we may Overlook

something of vital

importance we may neglect an opportunity

a gift that could fundamentally change

how we experience our

day that gift is the Holy Spirit you can

invite the Holy Spirit to be your

constant companion knowing that he is

faithful to be with you and to work in

and through you for God's glory so you

might be thinking what does it really

mean to start your day with the holy

spirit it's not as simple as pouring a

cup of coffee or lacing up your shoes no

starting your day with the Holy Spirit

is so much more than that it is the

conscious decision to invite God through

his spirit to guide Inspire and walk

with you in all you do it is the desire

to not just live but to live in

communion with with our creator allowing

him to lead us in his perfect wisdom and

love in Acts 8: 29-30 the Bible says the

spirit told Phillip go to that Chariot

and stay near it then Philip ran up to

the Chariot and heard the man reading

Isaiah the prophet do you understand

what you are reading Philip asked in

these

verses Philip one of Jesus's disciples

is told by the Holy Spirit to go near a

chariot there's a man in the Chariot

reading the words of Isaiah a prophet

from the Old Testament part of the Bible

because the Holy Spirit told Philip to

go to The Chariot he was able to help

the man understand the words of Isaiah

this shows us how the Holy Spirit can

guide us to be in the right place at the

right

time just like Phillip when we start our

day with the Holy Spirit we can get

access to God's leading and God's wisdom

this is a good reason why we need need

to pray every morning and ask the Holy

Spirit to be with us as we go about our

day let us also consider the Apostle

Peter in Acts 10 Peter was praying on

the rooftop when he had a vision that

led him to a profound understanding of

God's unconditional love God through his

Spirit spoke to Peter guiding him

teaching him and preparing him for the

works he had planned at times you may

think that these stories seem distant or

they only happen in the Bible but that's

not true the same holy spirit that

guided philli and Peter is the same Holy

Spirit available to each of us every

morning the same God Who provided

strength and wisdom is there for us at

the start of each new day our challenges

might be different but we all face our

struggles it may be a Health crisis

financial difficulties or personal

struggles that threaten to consume us

but here's the profound truth when we

start our day with the Holy Spirit we're

not facing these trials alone as Paul

assured us in Romans

8:31 if God is for us who can be against

us so how do we invite the Holy Spirit

into our

mornings it starts with a simple

invitation in The Quiet Moments before

the day sweeps you away take a moment to

welcome God into your day it doesn't

require eloquent words or elaborate

prayers a heartfelt holy spirit guide me

today is more than enough let the Bible

be your morning

nourishment as you feed your body and

feed your

spirit let the word of God be the first

thing that you consume each day as we

are reminded in Deuteronomy

8:3 man does not live by bread

alone but man lives by every word that

comes from the mouth of the Lord Lord

inviting the Holy Spirit into your

mornings is a Daily Commitment it's a

journey filled with growth Discovery and

transformation there may be days when it

feels difficult days when you might

question if the holy spirit is truly

with you but remember the Holy Spirit

isn't based on feelings but on God's

promise he's there with you guiding you

even when you may not sense him and as

you begin your day with the Holy Spirit

anticipate the transformation that will

take place you will experience peace

amidst chaos strength in weakness and

Clarity in confusion Beyond these

blessings you will develop a

relationship with God that is deeper and

more intimate than anything this world

can offer so let us Embrace this

spiritual practice not just today but

every day beginning each day with god

with his holy spirit in second

Corinthians

13 verse 14 the Bible encourages us

saying May the grace of our Lord Jesus

Christ the love of God and the communion

of the Holy Spirit be with you

all now to all those within the sound of

my voice let us go to the Lord in

prayer I want you to pray this prayer

with me so that you can have all the

blessings of this prayer let us us pray

universe the maker of heaven and Earth

to you knowing that you will give me the

strength to keep going Lord may you give

me wisdom today you are the source of

that pleases is you father I pray for

good health in my body which serves as

the dwelling place for your Holy Spirit

Lord I pray for complete and divine

Health from the top of my head to the

soles of my feet I ask for your healing

touch I pray that each cell each organ

each system within my body functions

exactly as you designed it to May my

body be strong and able to fight off any

illness or disease that might try to

attack I pray for protection from harm

and danger and for you to Shield me from

any harmful substances or practices that

could harm my health Lord I pray for

your

blessings every good thing comes from

you and I ask that you would pour out

your blessings on me may you bless the

work I do Bless the people I love bless

help me to be a blessing to others you

use me to bring joy help and hope to the

people around me father I ask for your

spirit is my helper Lord may your Holy

Spirit help me remember that when God is

on my side nothing can stand against me

I pray that the holy spirit will always

remind me that nothing can take God's

love away from

me Holy Spirit in difficult times may

you remind me that nothing not life or

death Not Angels or

demons not the things that worry me

today nor the things that scare me about

the future can ever separate me from the

love of God May May the Holy Spirit

help me understand who I am through

Christ

self-control Lord help me to show the

fruits of the spirit in my life not just

for my own good but also for the benefit

of the people around me as I say this

prayer together with everyone

listening for every person opening their

heart to you right now I ask that you

fill them with your Holy Spirit and with

your love for anyone who needs strength

to get through the day Holy Spirit may

you give them strength and courage for

anyone who woke up feeling hurt or in

pain Holy Spirit may you you be their

comforter help them to feel calm when

their heart is worried for the person

who feels lost and need some help

figuring out what to do I ask holy

spirit that you be like a good friend

giving them leading and Direction Lord

thank you for hearing this prayer and

for everyone who is listening thank you

Lord for being my father my friend my

helper and my guide in Jesus name I pray

pray amen ask God to give you daily

Direction when you seek God first

seeking guidance every single day

something happens your life will never

be the same today God's reassuring voice

is saying to you but seek first the

kingdom of God and his righteousness and

all these things shall be added to you

Proverbs

3: 5-6 says

trust in the Lord with all your heart

and lean not on your own understanding

in all your ways acknowledge Him and He

Shall direct your paths so it's not

about knowing the way but knowing the

one who knows the way but hears the

catch it's not automatic it doesn't just

happen like that you have to do it on

purpose while opening your heart to

God Jesus taught Us in Matthew 6 verse

11 to pray this

way give us this day our daily bread

each day presents a new opportunity to

tune in and say Lord what is your plan

for today or Lord what is the direction

you would want me to take today it's

like having a spiritual compass that

always points North admitting that we

might not know the way but trusting that

he does is the first step to unlock

locking doors that we didn't even know

existed letting God take the lead in our

lives is like trusting someone else to

drive while we're in the passenger seat

it's about surrendering full control and

trusting God we're not trying to do

everything ourselves but instead we're

counting on God because he knows the way

better than we do this reminds me of one

of my favorite Bible

verses

Jeremiah

29:1 which says says for I know the

plans I have for you declares the Lord

plans to prosper you and not to harm you

plans to give you hope in a future by

believing in this promise we find

genuine Peace and Freedom knowing that

God is guiding us towards the best for

our lives each and every day now it's

tempting to draft the blueprints for our

own lives and then just hope that God

will just rubber stamp them but this

approach can lead us astray it's like

Noah trying to build an ark without

God's Specific Instructions it just

wouldn't float right instead let's turn

the tables before every decision big or

small why not consult God first if you

acknowledge the leading of the Holy

Spirit and there's peace in your heart

then you can move forward if there's

unease maybe it's a sign to hold off

remember when Abraham was told to leave

his homeland in Genesis

12:1 the Bible says now the Lord had

said to Abraham get out of your country

from your family and from your father's

house to a land that I will show you

Abraham didn't have a road map but he

had peace in his heart he had faith in

God's instructions so we need to seek

God daily it's about consistent

Fellowship think about it would you use

last week's news to understand today's

world events no you wouldn't similarly

our relationship with God is built on

daily and sometimes hourly conversations

it's about keeping that channel open

when we seek God daily we get clarity

life is filled with decisions some are

minor but others have the potential to

change the course of Our Lives navig

through these decisions can be

overwhelming however by consistently

Consulting with God we gain insights

that are beyond our human understanding

he provides us with a unique perspective

guiding our steps and ensuring that we

walk in the path he has laid out for us

each day's

challenges are met with a fresh word

from him guiding us towards choices that

align with his plan consistency in any

relation relationship leads to

intimacy my friends let me repeat that

again consistency in any relationship

leads to intimacy the more we engage

with God the more we understand his

character his love and his desires for

us this closeness builds trust when we

know God's heart we find it easier to

place our worries into his hands our

faith grows

as we witness his promises come to

fulfillment day after day a Daily

Commitment to seeking him ensures that

our bond with God becomes unshakable

even in life storms also in a world

filled with noise uncertainty and Chaos

seeking God daily becomes our anchor his

presence brings a piece that surpasses

human comprehension when everything

seems turbulent a daily dose of his word

acts like a calming bomb assuring us

that he is in control our Spirits are

rejuvenated and we are reminded of the

bigger picture his eternal plan for

us it's this peace that helps us face

challenges with courage and hope with

every

interaction God imparts wisdom the world

offers knowledge but God gives wisdom

which is the ability to apply that

knowledge correctly by seeking him daily

we tap into this Divine wisdom helping

us to discern situations and react in

ways that bring forth positive outcomes

this

wisdom not only benefits us but also

those around us it enables us to be

beacons of light offering Godly counsel

and Solutions in essence seeking God

daily is not a mere religious ritual

it's our

Lifeline it keeps us connected to the

source of our strength love and

purpose with every new Sunrise we're

given an opportunity to draw closer to

lean in and to be transformed by the

richness of his presence let's look at

the Israelites in Exodus

16:13 even when they were wandering and

felt lost God gave them daily Provisions

like quail

the Bible says that evening Quail came

and covered the camp and in the morning

there was a layer of dew around the

camp so this reminds us that God is

concerned about our daily struggles our

victories and everything in between are

we sometimes trapped in our own past

successes thinking old methods will

solve new

challenges we might think this feels

familiar

I know how to handle this but King

Solomon in his wisdom said in

Ecclesiastes

3:1 to everything there is a season a

time for every purpose under Heaven this

means that there is a time to change our

methods and our approach our world

evolves rapidly holding on to the past

or letting life pass by on

autopilot can leave us in the dust thank

y God's mercies are new Every Morning

Lamentations

3:

22-23 assures us through the Lord's

mercies we are not consumed because his

compassions fail not they are new every

morning great is your faithfulness if

you've been following the same

strategy for a while now perhaps it's

time to take another look at the guide

book

perhaps God wants to do something new or

something different in your life can you

handle

it Paul reminds us in

Philippians 4: 13 I can do all things

through Christ who strengthens me so

let's be ready for change refreshed

daily by his word and led by the holy

spirit in

essence life's journey isn't about

sticking to what we know it's about

consistent guidance from the one who

knows best so as we navigate the twists

and turns remember we have the best

guidebook at our fingertips let's dive

in and seek his

guidance Your Divine Compass awaits each

day it is very important to seek God's

guidance talk to God first remember the

tale of the Israelites and the golden

calf this can be found in Exodus 32

verses 1

to4 and the scripture reads and when the

people saw that Moses delayed to come

down from the mount the people gathered

themselves together unto Aaron and said

unto him up make us Gods which shall go

before us for as for this Moses the man

that brought us up out of the land of

Egypt we would not what is become of him

and Aaron said unto them break off the

Golden Earrings which are in the ears of

your wives of your sons and of your

daughters and bring them unto me and all

the people broke off the Golden Earrings

which were in their ears and brought

them unto Aaron and he received them at

their hand and fashioned it with a

graving tool after he had made it a

molten calf and they said these be thy

Gods o

Israel which brought the up out of the

land of Egypt we see here where Moses

was away on Mount Si

and the Israelites grew impatient rather

than waiting and seeking guidance they

took matters into their own hands

resulting in regrettable decisions

similarly when we Face

challenges it's not always about

charging forward sometimes it's about

pausing reflecting and seeking God's

guidance as we are reminded in Proverbs

3 veres

5-6 trust in the Lord Lord with all your

heart and lean not on your own

understanding in all your ways

acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your

paths instead of acting

hastily what if we took a moment to

consult with

God seeking his Direction can steer us

away from unnecessary conflicts and

decisions we might later regret reflect

upon David a man after God's Own Heart

even after defeating Goliath and many

foes he never assumed he knew best

before every major battle or decision he

sought the Lord's

counsel but why did David do this wasn't

he already an accomplished Warrior true

but he knew that God's perspective was

infinitely more valuable than his past

experiences in our lives we might think

I've done this before I got this but

like David

we should remember that every challenge

while it might seem familiar has its

unique

aspects seeking God's guidance andur as

we're aligning our steps with his plans

rather than our assumptions then there's

the cautionary tale of Joshua and the

deceptive

janit in Joshua chapters 9 and 10 their

trickery made them appear as allies from

afar but in reality they were close

neighbors if only Joshua had sought

God's wisdom their oversight meant years

of unexpected alliances and

challenges what can we learn from this

not everything is as it seems the world

can present us with golden opportunities

that without Divine guidance might turn

out to be mere

Illusions you've probably heard of the

saying all that Glitters Is Not Gold

this reminds me of a funny story where

two women mistook a rat for a

Chihuahua it looked innocent even

Charming but upon closer examination its

true nature was revealed

so before inviting situations or

Chihuahuas into our lives let's make

sure they're genuinely what they appear

to be a quick check with our heavenly

father can save a lot of heartaches my

friends as we navigate the vast

landscape of life let's remember to seek

God daily not just in the big decisions

but in the smaller seemingly

insignificant ones too whether it's a

business venture a new relationship or

even a seemingly familiar challenge

God's wisdom is essential if you've been

relying solely on your understanding and

experiences perhaps it's time for a

change today I invite you to seek fresh

guidance

a daily touch from God by doing so I

believe that God will guide your steps

Shield you from pitfalls and lead you to

a destiny filled with his blessings and

favor now to all those within the sound

of my

voice let us go to the Lord in

prayer I want you to pray this prayer

with me so that you can have all the

blessings of this prayer let us pray

to our gracious and loving God heavenly

father to you be all glory honor and

praise today I come before you with

gratitude in my heart and hope for the

day ahead give me this day my daily

bread I seek your forgiveness as I

forgive those who trespass against me I

thank you for life and for your many

blessings Lord I ask that you guide my

thought

words and actions today Lead Me In Paths

of righteousness and help me to be a

beacon of light and love to those I

encounter father I pray that I remain

rooted in your truth equipped to face

the challenges of the day with Grace and

courage in the name of Jesus I declare

Clarity for each step I take I seek your

wisdom in every decision I make and I

ask that you your voice be The Guiding

Light in my life in the name of Jesus I

rebuke any

confusion hesitation and uncertainty

that tries to cloud my judgment Lord

lead me away from any distractions

Temptations or

deceptions that aim to lead me astray I

claim

confidence Clarity and

guidance in the name of Jesus

knowing that you are directing my path

Lord I ask that you bring complete

healing to my body mind and soul by the

stripes of Jesus I am healed Lord I ask

that you strengthen me renew the right

Spirit within me and bring me peace

which surpasses all understanding father

I seek Your Divine protection over my

life and over the lives of my loved ones

I declare that everything is working for

us and not against us may you bless us

in our going out and coming in May You

Deliver Us from all evil and shield us

from negative

influences Lord keep us safe from the

snares of the enemy as I declare that no

weapon formed against us shall prosper

father I ask for your Abundant Blessings

in my

life may you open doors for me

shower me with your favor prosperity and

joy Lord as I say this prayer together

with everyone listening father I am

grateful for all the hearts that are

surrendering to you right now may every

one of us feel the warmth of your

embrace the confidence of your guidance

and the joy that comes from walking hand

in hand with you daily father

father help us not lean unto our own

understanding but to seek your leading

and direction in everything we do may

your guiding hand be upon us all giving

us daily direction towards your perfect

will in the name of Jesus I declare that

your love Grace mercies blessings and

abundance will flow into our lives today

thank you Lord for hearing and answering

my my prayer in the name of Jesus I pray

amen I want you to imagine a scene

something Jesus himself painted in Mark

4: 26 to

29 picture a farmer cradling a small

seed in the palm of his rough worn

hands the Setting Sun casts long

stretching Shadows over the waiting

Earth

now does this farmer parade around the

town showcasing his

seed talking about its potential or its

possibilities no instead he walks to his

field finds a spot and plants the seed

there hidden from the world's view this

is a secret silent Act of Faith between

him the seed and God and then in time

with nurturing care and patience that

little seed Sprouts it grows it becomes

a plant bearing fruit that feeds many

that seed is much like our dreams our

plans our goals today I want to talk to

you about a topic we don't often hear

why you should never tell anyone what

you are up to now we live in a time when

everything we do seems to be

broadcasted some of us share our

breakfast our holidays our good good

days and bad days on social media and if

it's not broadcasted on social media

it's shared within our Social

Circles but sometimes we talk too much

have we ever stopped to ask

ourselves do I need to tell everyone

everything well I am here to tell you

that telling everyone everything is not

wise you need to be careful about doing

that James 1: 19 reminds us so then my

beloved Brethren let every man be swift

to hear slow to speak slow to wrath have

you ever seen a baby bird in its nest

high up in a tree when a baby bird is

born it's weak and can't even fly yet it

needs to be safe from things that could

hurt it like cats dogs or even people

that's why birds build their nests in

secret places the these hidden nests are

where baby birds grow stronger Learn to

Fly and become big birds this is a bit

like what the Bible says in Matthew 6:

6 Jesus tells us but when you pray go

into your room close the door and pray

to your father who is unseen then your

father who sees what is done in secret

will reward you did you hear that what

does this mean for us

it's saying that our secret place like

the baby bird's nest is a significant

place this secret place could be your

room where you pray it could be a quiet

spot under a tree where you read your

Bible it could be inside your

heart where you talk to God this secret

place is away from the noise the eyes

and the words of other people it's just

you you and God in this secret place you

can grow you can learn more about God

you can get stronger in your faith like

the baby bird gets stronger in the nest

not everybody needs to see this growth

happening just like the baby bird

doesn't invite

everyone to see its

nest this growth is something special

between you and God so let's remember to

spend time in our secret place with God

we don't need to tell everyone what

we're doing or learning there it's a

special place where we can grow strong

in our faith and just like the baby bird

one day we'll be ready to fly one day

you will be able to share your testimony

or share a part of of your journey but

God's timing matters here now let's take

a moment to look at a man named nemiah

from the Bible nemiah was a hard worker

who was busy rebuilding the wall of

Jerusalem one day while he was working

some people tried to distract him they

called him to come down and stop his

work but nemiah knew that if he stopped

his work to entertain them his important

work work would not be finished the

scripture tells us in Nehemiah

6:3 he

said so I sent Messengers to them saying

I am doing a great work and I cannot

come down why should the work stop while

I leave it and come down to you nayah

did not let himself get

distracted he knew his work was

important he did not tell everyone what

he was doing or how he was doing it

he just stayed focused on his work we

can learn a lot from

[Music]

Naya sometimes we allow people to

distract us too

easily sometimes when we tell people

about our plans or what we are doing

they may try to distract us they may not

even understand or they may say things

that make us feel bad or confused but we

could avoid all of that this is why

sometimes

it may be a good idea to keep our plans

to ourselves keep out the distractions

it may hinder your success remember when

you have something important to do it's

okay to keep it between you and God you

don't have to share it with everyone

like neiah stay focused on your work or

goals and don't let others distract you

keep working hard and remember that God

sees your efforts even if no one else

does do you recall in the Bible when

Jesus healed a blind man at

Betha it's in the Book of Mark 8: 22- 26

then he came to Betha and they brought a

blind man to him and begged him to touch

him so he took the blind man by the hand

and led him out of the town and when he

had spit on his eyes and put his hands

on him he asked him if he saw anything

and he looked up and said I see men like

trees walking then he put his hands on

his eyes again and made him look up and

he was restored and saw everyone clearly

then he sent him away to his house

saying neither go into the town nor tell

anyone in the town so we see here that

after Jesus healed him he told the man

don't go into the town or tell anyone in

the town Jesus knew the right time to do

things

and he also knew that sometimes it was

best to keep things quiet this is also a

good lesson for us again it shows us

that not everything has to be told to

everyone sometimes it's better to keep

our plans or what we're doing is secret

even Jesus who did amazing things

sometimes chose to be

discreet just like Jesus we can be wise

and decide when it's the right time to

tell people about our plan hands and

when it's better to keep things quiet we

don't always have to let everyone know

what we're up to sometimes it's better

to just get on with our work and let

what we do speak for itself remember

being wise means knowing when to speak

and when to keep quiet not everyone

needs to know everything we're planning

or doing so let's be wise just like

Jesus was there's a beautiful line in

the Bible in Psalm 27

verse4 it says wait for the Lord be

strong and Let Your Heart Take courage

wait for the Lord this is a reminder for

us to be patient to wait for God's

perfect time just like how a flower

doesn't Bloom right after it's planted

our plans and dreams also take time to

grow God knows the best time for

everything we can trust him we don't

have to rush or be in a hurry it's okay

to wait it's okay to be patient and just

because we're waiting doesn't mean we

have to tell everyone what we're waiting

for we don't have to let everyone know

our every move we can keep our plans to

ourselves and when the right time comes

our plans will happen so let's be

patient let's wait for God's perfect

time let's not rush to tell everyone

what we're planning let's trust God and

let our plans happen in his time

remember good things take time and God's

time is always the best have you ever

thought about what real success means is

it when people applaud us or is it when

we know we have done our best the Bible

in Galatians

1:10 tells us something important about

this it says am I now trying to win the

approval of human beings or of God or am

I trying to please people if I were

still trying to please people I would

not be a servant of

Christ this means that we should not

work just to make people

happy we should not make plans or do

things just so people will like us or

think we are successful the most

important thing is that we do our best

and that God is happy with us this is

what what real success is we don't need

to show off we just need to work hard

and do our best and remember we're doing

it for God not for

people

so let's focus on doing our best let's

work hard and make our plans without

worrying about what others think because

real success is about pleasing God not

people now in the Book of Matthew

Chapter 7 ver 6 it says do not give dogs

what is sacred do not throw your pearls

to pigs if you do they may trample them

under their feet and turn and tear you

to pieces so what is this verse saying

to us it is saying we should not share

our precious things like our plans or

other personal details with people who

won't value them sometimes we might have

secret enemies people who don't wish us

well but we may not know it if we tell

them our plans they might use that

information against us or even use it to

harm us and sometimes it may be the root

cause of strife or Envy do you remember

the story of Samson found in the Book of

Judges chapter 16 Delilah persuaded

Samson into revealing that the secret of

his strength was his long hair Samson

told his secret to

Delilah because he thought she loved him

but Delilah was secretly working with

Samson's enemies when Samson told her

his secret she used it to help the

enemies capture

Samson this is an example of what can

happen when we share our plans or

secrets with the wrong people

so we must be careful we must be

vigilant and wise we should not tell

tell everyone our plans or share

personal details of Our Lives we should

ask God to help us know the people in

our Lives who want the best for

us these are the people who we can

sometimes share with but it's often

safer to keep our plans a secret until

they are ready to be shown to the world

don't hinder your own progress or block

your own Blessings by sharing too much

with the wrong people

now to all those within the sound of my

voice let us go to the Lord in prayer I

want you to pray this prayer with me so

that you can have all the blessings of

my

Lord for

hearing and answering my prayer I pray

all this in the precious and mighty name

of Jesus

Christ amen Our God has infinite wisdom

and power

and so I encourage you to let go of your

worries and fears and leave the things

you can't control to God have you ever

tried to control something and realize

that you just

can't imagine you're in a tiny boat and

you're stuck in the middle of a big

scary storm you have no power to stop

the storm but what if you knew someone

who

could our lives are often like that we

find ourselves in situations we can't

control

like the storm but sometimes we often

forget that we have a choice it may not

appear like you have a choice but you do

we can worry and try to fix things

ourselves or we can trust in the one who

has power over everything even the storm

as humans we love to be in

charge it makes us feel safe and

Powerful however we must understand our

limits God made the world and everything

in it he is the one in control not us

but we can find comfort in knowing we're

part of God's grand

plan job 26:7 reminds us that God

stretches out the north over the void

and hangs the Earth on nothing our God

is all powerful we all know that life

can be tricky with surprises around

every corner the Bible reminds us in

Ecclesiastes 3:1 that everything in life

has its own time this means there are

things happening that we just can't

control or predict we can't control the

weather can we and just like the weather

some things in life are beyond our

control that's just how it is it's

natural to feel like you want to be in

control of

everything we like to feel safe and

secure and being in control seems to

offer that but the truth is we can't

control everything no we can't there

there are things in life that are simply

beyond our

reach when we try to control everything

we only end up tired and

stressed this is because we are human

and we have limits in the Book of

Ecclesiastes it says there is a time for

everything sometimes the time comes for

us to let go of our need for control and

let God take over let go and let God so

why should we let God take control

God's wisdom and power are beyond what

we can imagine unlike us God isn't

limited by time or space Psalm 1047 ver

5 says his understanding is Limitless he

knows the beginning from the end and

everything in

between he knows what's best for us even

when we can't see it we often face

things we don't understand and that's

okay we can be sure that God knows what

he is doing his ways are higher than

ours as we learn in Isaiah 55: 8 to9 for

my thoughts are not your thoughts

neither are your ways my ways declares

the Lord surrendering doesn't mean we've

lost or given up it means we have faith

in God when we stop trying to control

everything and trust God we show our

belief in his great power and wisdom the

Bible is filled with people who trusted

God during tough times let's look at the

story of Jehoshaphat As Told in 2

Chronicles 20 Jehoshaphat the king of

Judah was terrified when vast armies

came against him but instead of trying

to control the situation himself he

turned to God he prayed saying we do not

know what to do but our eyes are on you

then led by their faith Jehoshaphat and

his people went out to meet the armies

instead of fighting they sang praises to

God and God took control the enemy

armies became confused and destroyed

each

other josaphat and his people didn't

have to fight at all they trusted God

and saw his power at work when we trust

God we're showing our faith in him let's

look at another story the story of King

Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20 he was very sick

so sick that the prophet Isaiah told him

he would die but Hezekiah turned to God

In Prayer are trusting him even in the

face of death and you know

what God heard his prayer and added 15

more years to his life just like

Hezekiah when we trust God in the face

of the uncontrollable we allow his

divine plan to unfold in our lives

that's when Miracles will start to

happen right before our very eyes when

we trust God with things we can't

control we can feel a peace that's hard

to explain it's a peace that is more

than we can understand and even though

we may face difficult times God promises

us peace in our hearts Philippians 4:7

says and the peace of God which

surpasses all understanding will guard

your hearts and your minds in Christ

Jesus our peace comes from knowing that

the God who made the

universe the God who set the stars in

the sky and knows each one by name is

the same God who watches over us he

knows our struggles and our worries he

sees our tears and he cares about what

we're going

through Psalms

34:18

says the Lord is close to the

Brokenhearted and saves those who are

crushed in spirit when we let go and

trust God we can sleep peacefully even

when the world around us is in

chaos we can face tomorrow without fear

knowing that whatever happens God is

with us we can walk through the fire and

not be

burned and through the waters and not be

drowned it's no wonder the songwriter

says Because He Lives I Can Face

tomorrow because he lives all fear is

gone now the peace we get from trusting

God doesn't mean there won't be storms

it doesn't mean that we won't face

difficulties or go through hard times

but it does mean that in the middle of

those storms and difficulties we can

have a

calmness a Stillness a peace that is not

of this world because our trust is not

in this

world but in the God who made it and

knowing that he is in

control knowing that he will never fail

us gives us a peace that's hard to

explain but wonderful to experience

God's love for us never never

fails and he is always true to his word

the Bible is filled with examples of

God's unfailing love and faithfulness

remember the story of the Israelites in

the

wilderness after they were freed from

slavery in

Egypt they complained and turned away

from God yet God remained

faithful he provided Mana bread from

heaven for them to eat

he demonstrated his power and love even

when the people were faithless this

reminds us that God will not fail us he

loves us more than we can know it also

means that whatever God promises he

does if God says he will do something

you can be sure that he will do it it's

like if your best friend promises to

help you you believe them because you

know they always keep their promises God

is like that but even much better

whenever he makes a promise in the Bible

he always keeps it now when we surrender

our worries to God we can do so through

prayer this is how we talk to God when

we pray we can tell God about all our

worries and fears and God because He

Loves Us gives us peace 1 Peter 5 verse

7 says cast all your anxieties on him

because he cares for you

surrendering our worries To God In

Prayer means that we stop trying to deal

with everything by

ourselves it means that we trust God to

help us we say to God I can't do this by

myself I'm giving my worries to you Lord

please help me when we do that we stop

carrying all that heavy worry by

ourselves we share it with God we give

it to God and because God is so big and

strong he can handle any worry we have

and the best part is that God wants to

help us with our worries because he

loves us so much so prayer is like

saying God I trust you with my worries I

need your help and when we do that we

often start to feel better it's like a

weight being lifted off our shoulders

that's also

consider the idea of Victory through

surrender it may seem strange

Victory how can we win by giving up but

in God's kingdom

surrendering is how we gain Victory when

we stop trying to control everything and

trust God we become

Victorious that's how we conquer fear

worry and stress let's look at the story

of the Israelite city of Jericho in the

Book of Joshua the city walls were too

strong to be conquered by by force God

instructed Joshua and the Israelites to

March around the city for seven days and

on the seventh day to blow their

trumpets and Shout by the world

standards this plan made no sense but

the Israelites surrendered their

understanding and followed God's command

when they did the mighty walls of

Jericho fell down and the Israelites won

a victory that they couldn't have

achieved on their own in our lives too

there are walls that we can't bring down

by our own

efforts these might be problems or

challenges that we can't solve no matter

how hard we try or it may be a person we

can't change or a situation we can't

control whenever we find ourselves in

such situations we tend to feel stuck

helpless or

discouraged we may try everything we can

think of to fix it but nothing works we

are just left feeling more stressed

worried and tired if it's like trying to

open a door that's locked tight but when

we surrender these situations to God he

can do what we

can't imagine God has the key to that

locked door when we hand over our

problems to him he unlocks the door now

this doesn't mean that everything

suddenly becomes perfect but it does

mean that we're not alone in facing our

problems God is with us working on our

problems in ways we can't even imagine

once we surrender our situations to God

we might not see changes right away

God's timing is different from ours but

one thing is certain God is working on

our behalf his ways are always better

than ours and just like a

parent who stops their child from

touching a hot

stove God sees the big picture and knows

what's best for us so in those moments

when we feel like we're banging on a

locked door remember this god holds the

key we only need to hand our problems

over to him trust in his perfect timing

and Believe In His Infinite Wisdom when

we do that we'll find that God will do

what we can from today onwards let's

learn to leave the things we can't

control to God he will never fail us

give it to Jesus Remember Jehoshaphat

the manner in the wilderness and the

walls of Jericho these stories teach us

that when we surrender to God he takes

over and when God takes over miracles

happen remember God loves you he cares

for you he is wiser and stronger than we

can ever be trust him with your

worries surrender them to him pray to

him and in him you will find Victory and

peace now to all those within the sound

of my voice voice let us go to the Lord

in

prayer I want you to pray this prayer

with me so that you can have all the

blessings of this prayer let us pray to

Jesus name I pray amen just as Psalm 91

assures us even in the darkest hours

there is a shelter where waiting for you

a hope that never Fades and a promise

that you are always protected under his

wings today God is offering this special

promise to you I'm also going to pray a

powerful prayer with you calling on God

to be your refuge and strength in the

name of Jesus so watch until the end and

open your heart to receive the blessings

of this prayer think about this for a

moment what is the deepest desire of the

human heart when life feels uncertain

when dangers and trials Loom when fears

creep in do you know this is it we yearn

for Refuge protection and comfort we

long for a safe dwelling place where we

can find

Shelter From the storms of life but you

need not

despair for We Have A Mighty Fortress

and an eternal home

in the shelter of the most high Psalm 91

stands as a source of divine Assurance

in times of trouble promising that as we

abide in the Lord no evil shall conquer

us this powerful

Psalm still has much relevance and power

today as it did when it was first

written years ago so the question is how

can we all unlock the power of this

Psalm are the promises of Psalm 91 one

just for some people before we dig

deeper let us quickly examine each verse

in Psalm

91:1 it says he who dwells in the secret

place of the most high shall abide under

the shadow of the

almighty our shelter and Shadow of

protection is in the most high God we

all face storms in life but God is our

refuge and shelter ready to cover us

with his wings when troubles come I

encourage you to run to him first when

you need protection verse two tells us I

will say of the Lord he is my refuge and

my Fortress my God in him I will trust

our faith and trust in God is what

allows us to say he is our refuge it's

not just knowing about God but it is

putting our complete trust in him

that brings the benefits of this Psalm

to life so you should ask yourself do I

truly trust him in All situations or do

I sort my troubles and decide which ones

are too big for God to handle and which

ones aren't verses 3 to 4 says surely he

shall deliver You From The Snare of the

Fowler and from the perilous pestilence

he shall cover you with his feathers and

under his wings you shall take refuge

his truth shall be your shield and

buckler this is telling us that God will

Deliver Us from traps and

dangers he will cover us with his

feathers but know that God doesn't

always keep us from going through

difficulties but he promises to be with

us in them protecting us

supernaturally even when we can't see

how have faith that he is shielding you

verses 5 to6 assures us

you shall not be afraid of the terror by

night nor of the arrow that flies by day

nor of the pestilence that walks in

darkness nor of the destruction that

lays waste at

Noonday so we can rest assured that no

evil shall conquer us because God is our

defense believe that no weapon formed

against you can ultimately succeed or

overpower you when God is on your side

stand firm in that confidence no matter

what verses 7 to

8 says a thousand may fall at your side

and 10,000 at your right hand but it

shall not come near you only with your

eyes shall you look and see the reward

of the Wicked This is reminding us that

God Faithfully protects those who love

him even in midst of judgment our

relationship with Christ ensures we are

covered cling close to him obey his

words to abide under his protection

verses 9 to13 reminds us because you

have made the Lord who is my refuge even

the most high your dwelling place no

evil shall befall you nor shall any

plague come near your dwelling for he

shall give his angels charge over you to

keep you in all your ways in their hands

they shall bear you up lest you dash

your foot against a stone you shall

tread upon the lion and the Cobra the

Young Lion and the serpent you shall

trample

underfoot this is a promise of

Supernatural protection and

Care over every part of our Lives when

we belong to

God thank him daily for being your

shelter verse 14 says because he has set

his love upon me therefore I will

deliver him I will set him on high

because he has known my name our God

delivers and protects because we know

and trust in his name our faith in who

God is and what he can do allows us to

access the Deliverance spoken of in this

verse strengthen your knowledge of his

nature and

character trust in him and verses

15-6 tells us he shall call upon me and

I will answer him I will be with him in

trouble I will deliver him and honor him

with long life I will satisfy him and

show him my salvation these verses

Express God's unwavering commitment to

us when we call on God he is there when

we reach out to him in prayer not only

does he promise to answer but he also o

assures us of his constant presence

during hard times delivering us from

those challenges He blesses us with a

fulfilling life while revealing the

depth of his Saving

Grace so run to the Lord

instantly in prayer when you need help

or

protection he promises to be there right

beside you our God is faithful sometimes

all you need to say is help Lord call

out to God he promises to answer and

deliver you so when we put it all

together let us unlock the benefits of

Psalm 91 what does Psalm 91 really offer

I will discuss five powerful Promises of

this Psalm number one it promises Divine

shelter notice that Psalm

91 opens with these profound words he

who dwells in the sea secret place of

the most high shall abide under the

shadow of the almighty what a beautiful

promise for our weary souls for those

with heavy hearts the shelter of God

Almighty provides not only physical

protection from danger but also mental

and spiritual Refuge from fear and worry

so no matter what storms may come God

offers himself as a safe hiding place in

our modern world

we often grapple with economic

uncertainty with many false realities in

mainstream and social media with

political divisions Public Health crisis

and so much more as a result of all this

the need for shelter and refuge is as

crucial as ever but the promises of

Psalm 91 remain constant if we abide

under the wings of our Lord he promises

to cover us with his feathers and under

his wings we will find Refuge his

faithfulness is our shield and buckler

when we dwell in the most high we can

declare with

confidence that God Alone is our refuge

our Fortress Our God in whom we trust

sheltered safely in his presence we need

not fear the Terrors of the night or the

arrows that fly by Day verse 9

reiterates go God's Sheltering presence

because you have made the Lord your

Dwelling Place the most high who is my

refuge verse 4 also assures us that

under his wings we will find Refuge then

verse 10 expands on this thought no harm

will overtake you no disaster will come

near your tent this is a remarkable

promise of Supernatural protection and

safety for those abiding close to the

Lord number two it offers us the

ultimate Shield against fear our world

today is marked by fear and anxiety over

many things including our future our

health finances relationships and Public

Safety just a name a few but Psalm 91

addresses these fears that can dominate

our thoughts verse three promises that

God will Deliver Us From The Deadly

pestilence and plague in addition to

physical illness we we could also apply

this verse

symbolically God can Deliver Us from

contagious and harmful thoughts or

emotions further on verse 5 also Echoes

This Promise of protection from the

terror by night nor of the arrow that

flies by day nor of the pestilence that

walks in darkness so God is our ultimate

Shield against everything that seeks to

instill worry and fear verse 6 expands

on this theme of protection stating the

plague will not come near our dwelling

offering safety even in the midst of

widespread chaos while the sources of

our anxiety and stress may be different

than in ancient times God's power to

protect his children remains unchanged

number three it offers Angelic

guardianship Psalm

91 verses 11 to 12 paints a beautiful

picture of God commanding his angels

concerning us to guard Us in all our

ways and bear us up in their hands lest

we strike our feet against a stone those

who take refuge in the Lord have

Heavenly protectors attending their

every step intervening

supernaturally though we may not visibly

see their work Believers can take great

encouragement that powerful Angelic

beings are on assignment to provide

guidance protection and rescue us from

harm when we feel uncertain of the path

ahead we can call upon God to allow

these Guardians to light our way and

clear obstacles that would cause us to

falter in our faith number four it

promises triumph over

trials Psalm

91 also uses symbolic language to

describe the power that God gives his

children to overcome become hardship

verse

133 declares you shall tread upon the

lion and the Cobra the Young Lion and

the serpent you shall trample

underfoot therefore you need to start

declaring that the enemy is under your

feet because he is and he knows that

it's just for you to know also and to

act accordingly for modern Believers our

lions and serpents likely take different

forms such as an abusive relationship

addiction

discrimination depression or religious

persecution among others but through

faith in God's unfailing

protection we can have the courage to

face these

challenges refusing to give in when

faced with

adversity by relying on the strength of

the Almighty we can Crush these

obstacles beneath our feet and number

five it offers the power power of

relationship

now listen to this while Psalm 91 makes

magnificent promises the psalm itself

clarifies that its Provisions are not

unconditional two prerequisites for

resting in God's Refuge are mentioned

its promises are for those who know his

name as mentioned in verse

14 and those who love him which is also

mentioned in verse 14 so a personal

relationship with God is essential to

unlocking the power of Psalm 91 its

promises are not for everyone yet

everyone has an equal opportunity to be

able to gain access to the benefits of

these promises so amidst the many

messages out there proclaiming the power

of Psalm

91 as if it is generally for

everyone we must discern the truth this

s is indeed a potent passage but it

specifically promises protection to

those who truly know and love God

Understanding God's name means really

getting to know who he is on a deep

level just knowing that God exists isn't

enough we have to get close to him and

truly learn about him loving God isn't

just doing things for him it's truly

honoring and pleasing him in all we do

when we both know and love him that's

when we can truly unlock the full power

of abiding in his shelter that's when we

can unlock the power of Psalm 91 so if

you're listening and you've never

accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and

savior if you haven't yet come to know

and love God deeply don't worry the

journey to a close relationship with him

is open to everyone salvation has come

to you and you can accept Jesus today

watch until the end and I will pray a

special salvation prayer with you so

what is the practical application of all

this how can we apply Psalm 91 to our

lives

firstly make it a part of your daily

Refuge followers of Christ should make

Psalm 91 a part of their daily spiritual

meditation reading reciting or

meditating on these magnificent promises

sets our mind on his protection amidst

the days

uncertainties ending each day reflecting

on these Divine

assurances also allows peace and comfort

to carry us into rest let this Psalm

soak deep into your soul write its

verses on your sticky notes stuck to

your mirrors doors desk or anywhere that

will keep your eyes fixed on the words

throughout your daily routine there is

no better way to claim the Psalms Refuge

than by constantly renewing our minds

with its truths Romans 10:7 reminds us

so then faith comes by hearing and

hearing by the word of God secondly by

answering the call to trust trust is an

act of the will a deliberate dependence

on God's faithfulness despite our

feelings or circumstances when faced

with uncertainty anxiety tries to drink

our perception of God but you can combat

fear with radical trust choose daily to

believe his promises over your

perceptions recall past situations where

he protected and delivered you take

refuge under his wings until confidence

in his care becomes bigger than your

worry thirdly by embracing Angelic help

begin acknowledging out loud when Divine

guidance and protection show up in your

life when a coincidence redirects you

from danger or a call or text arrives

just when you need

encouragement begin to recognize it as a

possible Angelic intervention set your

mind to spot the Angels God promised to

dispatch around your path use your

spiritual eyes and senses to sense their

presence you may never physically see

these guardians but their handiwork is

all around for those with eyes to see it

and lastly by the Assurance of answered

prayer you should bring Psalm

91 boldly before God's throne of grace

in prayer Pray its verses out loud as

Declarations of Faith over your mind

body family and

circumstances allow each promise to fuel

your

requests then watch expectantly for

these prayers to be answered knowing

Heaven is mobilized on your behalf write

down and share testimonies of God's

protection with others before you know

it you will have lots of testimonies to

share so Psalm 91 in just 16 verses

forms a powerful

Declaration of radical Reliance Upon Our

loving Creator its promises reveal that

despite the everchanging threats we Face

The Refuge of dwelling close to God's

heart remains constant nothing and shake

Thank you for hearing and answering my

pray amen don't block your

blessings remember our God is a god of

abundance and he desires nothing more

than to bless us beyond our wildest

dreams so let's not stand in our own way

Embrace his will his love and His

blessings

today God wants to bless you with an

abundant life

we're also going to pray a powerful

prayer with you calling on God to bless

you abundantly in the name of Jesus so

watch until the end and open your heart

to receive the blessings of this prayer

my dear friends there is a sad reality

that we must face in our walk with God

sometimes without even realizing it we

become our own stumbling

blocks sometimes we wonder why the

heavens seems silent or why our prayers

feel unanswered we pour out our hearts

in prayer waiting and yearning for a

sign an answer or even just a whisper to

assure us that he hears we question have

we been forgotten is there something

we've done wrong but the truth is

blessings from God flow constantly like

a river quite often it is our actions

our choices and our attitudes that may

be preventing these blessings from RE

reaching us you

see God's love for us is so vast and his

desire to bless us is so immense that

His blessings are always flowing much

like a mighty river that never runs dry

this river is full of healing hope

breakthroughs and miracles all waiting

to enrich our lives but just as a river

can be hindered by

obstructions sometimes it's our own

behaviors to decisions and even the

state of our hearts that act like

barriers blocking these blessing we

might not even be aware of these

obstructions as they often masquerade as

everyday choices or Dee rooted attitudes

today let us dig deeper into

understanding these barriers and how we

can restore the free flow of God's grace

in our journey of life God continuously

weaves threads of Grace favor and love

for each one of us but it's up to us to

recognize and receive these threads to

allow them to enrich the patterns of our

lives today we will look at five

barriers that can block your blessings

and breakthroughs number one

unforgiveness and holding on to grudges

think of

unforgiveness like holding on to a heavy

Rock in our hand day after day that Rock

gets harder and harder to carry it slows

us down and tires us out that's what

holding grudges does to us it's like

that heavy Rock making our life harder

than it should be the Bible tells us

clearly in Matthew 6 verse 14 for if you

forgive others when they do wrong to you

your father in heaven will also forgive

you this means that if we want God to

forgive us we need to forgive others

it's a simple idea but sometimes it may

be hard to do depending on the

situation but we can all choose to

forgive no matter how difficult do what

God wants you to do and God will take

care of everything else now let's

Journey back to an often overlooked

story in the

Bible the story of Esau and Jacob these

two brothers had every reason to hold

onto

grudges Jacob with the help of their

mother deceived his older brother Esau

to snatch away his Birthright and

blessing the hurt and betrayal led to

years of separation and

bitterness Esau was so angry that he

even thought of killing Jacob but over

time something transformational happened

when they finally met again instead of

anger and revenge this is what happened

Genesis

33 verse 4

says but Esau ran to meet him and

embraced him and fell on his neck and

kissed him and they wept this reunion

shows the power of

forgiveness and how it can turn years of

bitterness into a moment of love and

Reconciliation yet it's vital to

understand that forgiveness is not just

for the person who hurt us it's also for

our benefit

it sets us free holding on to anger

resentment and grudges is like drinking

poison and expecting the other person to

get hurt it affects our

well-being our relationship with God and

others and prevents us from experiencing

the fullness of God's

blessings when we forgive we are not

saying that what the other person did is

okay but we are releasing them from our

judgment and letting God be the judge in

in doing so we Tear Down the Walls that

block our blessings and pave the way for

healing peace and spiritual Prosperity

after all every time we recite the

Lord's Prayer we are reminded forgive us

our trespasses as we forgive those who

trespass against us in essence every

prayer is a call to embrace forgiveness

and let go of the chains that hold us

back from God's Divine blessings number

two doubt and lack of faith doubt can

Cloud our spiritual vision making it

hard to recognize and appreciate the

Miracles that God manifests in our lives

daily like a dense fog it distorts our

perception and Direction when Jesus

beckoned Peter to walk on water it was

pure unwavering faith that enabled him

to take those initial miraculous steps

however the the instant doubt seeped in

he began to sink as James 1:6 tells us

but let him ask in faith with no

doubting for He Who doubts is like a

wave of the sea driven and tossed by the

wind this wavering and unstable State of

Mind keeps us from fully embracing God's

blessings imagine trying to paint a

beautiful picture but every time you're

about to make a stroke you set second

guess the color Choice the brush size or

the direction of the stroke because of

this the canvas remains incomplete and

the image never fully comes to life

similarly in our spiritual journey when

we're constantly doubting or lacking

faith we prevent our relationship with

God from reaching its full vibrant

potential we end up with a patchy

unclear image of his plan for us rather

than the Masterpiece he envisions in the

Bible Hebrews 11:1 tells us now Faith is

the substance of things hoped for the

evidence of things not seen this means

that even if we can't see something we

can believe it's there just like we

believe the wind is there when we feel

it on our face even if we can't see it

faith is believing in God and his

promises even if we can't see him

there's a story in the Bible about a man

named Barack in the Book of Judges

chapters 4 to

5 Deborah A

prophetes told barck that God wanted him

to lead an Army against their enemies

and God would ensure they win but Barack

doubted he said he would only go if

Deborah went with him this showed his

lack of faith because of this Deborah

said that the honor of Victory would go

to a woman and instead of him and that's

exactly what happened a woman named J

was the one who defeated the enemy's

leader this story shows what can happen

when we doubt or don't have faith we

might miss out on the good things God

has planned for us we can miss out on

our blessings so doubt as a human

emotion is natural all of us at

different moments grapple with questions

or uncertainties but in these times s

it's crucial to turn to God seeking his

wisdom and guidance embracing Faith

especially in uncertain times

illuminates our path providing Clarity

and purpose it's like having the right

colors and vision to complete our

painting revealing a beautiful Divine

Masterpiece God is ever ready to guide

but it's our faith and trust in him that

transforms his God guidance into

blessings in our lives number three

Disobedience and straying from God's

path not obeying God can cause you to

lose your way think about a time when

someone gave you a map or directions to

a place but instead of following it you

decided to go your own way thinking it

might be a shortcut but soon you found

yourself lost wishing you had just stuck

to the original path this is similar to

our spiritual journey God gives us a map

through his words in the Bible guiding

us on the right path but when we decide

to go our own way not listen to him we

often find ourselves feeling lost and F

from him God is clear about obedience in

the Bible in first Samuel 15:22 it says

to obey is better than sacrifice and to

heed is better than the fat of Rams this

means that God values our obedience more

than any any gift or ritual we can offer

he wants us to listen to him and follow

his ways because he knows it's the best

for us a story in the

Bible That's not often talked about but

is very relevant to our topic of

disobedience is about King Saul and the

amalekites in 1

Samuel chapter 15 God gave Saul clear

instructions to destroy everything

belonging to the amalekites because of

the harm they had done to the

Israelites but instead Saul spared their

King haak and kept some of the best

livestock he thought he could use these

animals as sacrifices to God but God

wasn't pleased because Saul didn't

follow his exact instructions even

though Saul thought he was doing a good

thing by saving the animals for

sacrifice he missed the point obedience

to God was more important as a result of

his

disobedience God no longer desired for

King Saul to remain as king and his

Reign took a tragic turn when we stray

from God's path and don't listen to him

it's like we're missing out on the best

route he has planned for us God's path

is always for our good even if we don't

see it right away by being obedient and

sticking to his

directions we avoid many problems and

heartaches it's essential to always

check in with God read his words and

pray for guidance just like that map or

set of directions God's word will always

lead us to the right place full of

blessings and peace so let's make an

effort to stay on God's path and enjoy

the journey he has prepared for us

number four pride and self reliance here

I am talking about the tendency to trust

ourselves more than God consider that

you have a puzzle and you're trying to

fit a piece where it doesn't belong no

matter how much you push or twist it it

just won't fit but instead of looking

for the right piece you keep forcing the

wrong one thinking you know better this

is what happens when we let Pride

control us and rely too much on

ourselves we try to force things our way

even if it's not the right way instead

of listening to God's guidance the Bible

has clear words about Pride Proverbs

16:18 says Pride goes before destruction

and a haughty spirit before a fall this

verse is a reminder that when we think

too highly of ourselves we're setting

ourselves up for trouble God wants us to

be humble to realize that we don't have

all the

answers and to lean on him let's look at

the story of King oziah in 2 Chronicles

chapter 26 Isaiah became king at a young

age and for many years he did what was

right in God's eyes he was successful

and Powerful

but with this power Pride started to

creep into his heart he began to think

he could do anything even tasks reserved

for priests one day he went into the

temple to burn incense a job only the

priests were allowed to do when warned

by the

priests instead of listening and

humbling himself aah became angry but

God saw his pride Isaiah broke out with

Leprosy right there and then Isaiah's

Pride led to his downfall trusting in

ourselves and thinking we don't need

God's guidance is a dangerous path it's

like refusing to ask for directions when

we're lost just because we're Too Proud

to admit we don't know the way so some

of us need to admit that we don't know

everything some of us are too proud but

God is always waiting for us to reach

out to ask him for help he wants to

guide us and lead us to the best paths

the key is to be humble to admit when we

need help and to trust in God's wisdom

over our own by setting aside our pride

and leaning on God we open up a world of

blessings peace and true success in our

lives remember it's okay to not have all

the answers as long as we know where to

turn for guidance don't let Pride block

your blessings and number five neglect

of prayer and praise this is like

drifting away from our Safe Harbor think

about being in a boat and floating in a

vast ocean near the shoreline is a safe

harbor where you anchor every every day

it provides protection guidance and a

sense of Peace but gradually you start

neglecting the anchor one day you skip

it thinking it's fine to drift a little

the next day you do the same slowly you

find yourself far out at Sea a drift and

the once familiar Harbor is barely

visible this is similar to our

relationship with God when we we

consistently engage in prayer and praise

to God we anchor ourselves to his

presence but neglecting these practices

is like neglecting that anchor letting

ourselves drift farther from God's

protective Harbor the Bible is filled

with calls for constant communication

with God in Philippians

4:6 we are reminded be anxious for

nothing but in everything by prayer and

supplication with Thanksgiving

let your requests be made known to God

the scripture underscores the importance

of not only praying but also offering

praise and thanks affirming our trust in

him by doing so we strengthen our anchor

ensuring we stay close to our spiritual

Harbor the story of Jonah nicely

reflects the significance of consistent

communication with God when God first

called Jonah to go to Nineveh Jonah ran

away opting to board a ship going in the

opposite direction he tried to escape

God's call and in doing so found himself

in the middle of a massive storm as he

neglected his duty and his connection to

God he drifted further away from his

spiritual Harbor it was only when he was

in the belly of a great fish having

prayed and repented that he was set back

on the right path Jonah's story is a

vivid illustration of what can happen

when we neglect our spiritual duties

like prayer and praise and how we can

always turn back to God our steadfast

Harbor no matter how far we've drifted

in our busy lives it's easy to think we

can skip a prayer session today or skip

a daily devotion or miss a moment of

praise to God tomorrow maybe you're

thinking that dealing with kids and

grandkids as they go back to school is

now top priority or dealing with my

other family or work obligations is more

important right now or you're probably

just thinking I don't have enough time

to spend 20 minutes or 30 minutes with

God every day but every time we do this

it's like allowing our boat to drift a

bit further from that Safe

Harbor over time we may find ourselves

lost in the vastness of life's

challenges prayer and praise are more

than just expression of

devotion they are also conduits of

blessings just as the rain nourishes the

Earth leading to blossoming flowers and

thriving crops consistent prayer and

heartfelt praise open the floodgates of

Heaven allowing God's blessings to flow

into our lives when we communicate with

God through prayer we align our desires

with his will making way for blessings

tailored to our truest needs s on the

other hand praise is our acknowledgement

of God's sovereignty our genuine

gratitude for his works when we praise

we recognize and celebrate the blessings

we've already received no matter how big

or small we also recognize and celebrate

the blessings and breakthroughs that we

expect to receive this grateful heart in

turn attracts even more

blessings Psalm 6 67:

5-6 beautifully shows this let the

people praise thee Oh God let all the

people praise thee then shall the Earth

yield her increase and God even our own

God shall bless us the scripture clearly

links praise with the outpouring of

blessings so by embracing a life rich in

prayer and overflowing with praise we

not only anchor ourselves to God but

also position ourselves to be in the

direct path of his Abundant Blessings

Now remember this as we journey through

life let us be

wise may we recognize the barriers in

our lives remove them and realign

ourselves with God's purpose thereby

ensuring that we do not block but rather

embrace the blessings he has for us let

today be the day of

transformation of openness and of

abundance Abundant Blessings our creator

and His Infinite Wisdom gave us Free

Will and with that comes the

responsibility of the choices we make if

our hearts and minds are filled with

doubt negativity or

distractions it becomes hard for God's

blessings to find their rightful place

in our lives the ever-flowing river is

always there we just need to be open and

ready to receive from it don't block

your blessings let let them flow now to

all those within the sound of my voice

let us go to the Lord in prayer I want

you to pray this prayer with me so that

you can have all the blessings of this

prayer let us pray to our gracious and

loving God Heavenly Father creator of

all things in heaven and earth I exalt

your mighty name I thank you Lord that

humble heart asking for your forgiveness

unknowingly placed barriers in the path

trespasses even as I forgive all those

in the name of Jesus let them experience

an overflow of your grace love and favor

in every area of their lives as I say

this prayer together with everyone

listening Lord I Thank you for every

heart that is humbled before you right

now I pray that a mighty wave of

Spiritual Awakening and realization will

sweep across every heart let the scales

fall from our

eyes so we may see clearly the ways in

to draw closer to you to live in harmony

with your will and to be open vessels

ready to receive your endless gifts

thank you Father for hearing and

answering my prayer with an expectant

heart I look forward to the

manifestation of your Abundant Blessings

In My Life in the precious name of Jesus

I pray amen have you ever wondered if

you have the Holy Spirit or have you

ever found yourself questioning whether

the holy spirit is active in your life

you're certainly not

alone if we are honest many of us

grapple with these very thoughts at

different points in our spiritual

journey

so how can we identify the signs of the

holy spirit in our everyday lives today

as we take a look at some of the signs

of the Holy Spirit

I want to encourage you to not just know

about the Holy Spirit but to truly know

him there is a big difference come to

experience the Holy Spirit and let him

lead you every step of the way your life

will never be the same I am also going

to pray a powerful prayer with you in

the name of

Jesus so watch until the end and open

your heart to receive the blessings of

this prayer the Bible offers clear

insights and assurances about the holy

spirit's presence in our lives Romans

8:9 says you however are not in the

realm of the flesh but are in the realm

of the spirit if indeed the spirit of

God lives in you and if anyone does not

have the spirit of Christ they do not

belong to

Christ this passage highlights that

having the holy spirit is a definitive

Mark of being a True Believer in Christ

furthermore Acts

2:38 advises us repent and be baptized

every one of you in the name of Jesus

Christ for the Forgiveness of your sins

and you will receive the gift of the

holy spirit this tells us that the holy

spirit is a gift given to all who

genuinely turn to Christ signaling the

beginning of a transformative

relationship ship

imagine holding a well-worn Bible its

Pages filled with little scribbles

highlighted verses and bookmarks even

though each page you turn tells stories

of Faith resilience and Redemption as

you read familiar verses comfort you

while new insights Challenge and grow

your faith each word each story in this

Bible reflects God's unwavering love for

us and that gentle nudge the quiet voice

in your heart guiding you to a

particular verse or Insight this is just

one example of what being led by the

spirit truly means

so when we talk about the Holy Spirit

we're not just speaking of a distant

concept or vague idea we are speaking of

the promised Holy Spirit God's

everpresent helper in our lives the holy

spirit is the living Breath of God the

force that can move mountains the spirit

is our helper standing by our side the

teacher that reveals truths the

comforter in times when we're

downhearted and the guide that directs

our steps on unfamiliar path and guides

us through the storms of life just as

Jesus said in John 14:

26 but the advocate the Holy Spirit whom

the father will send in my name will

teach you everything and remind you of

all I have shared with you through every

Twist and Turn of Life the holy spirit

is there playing multiple roles always

guiding teaching helping and comforting

Us in this journey as

Believers we realize that stepping into

faith is more than just a choice voice

it's an invitation to a life filled with

the power and love of Christ it's about

feeling a new energy the same energy

that empowered Jesus to perform Miracles

heal the sick and touch countless lives

but remember in Zechariah

4:6 the Bible tells us that it is not by

might nor by power but by my spirit this

verse emphasizes that it is God God's

spirit that empowers us to do

extraordinary things just as Jesus was

empowered to perform Miracles and heal

the sick from the stories in the New

Testament to the exciting adventures in

the book of Acts the holy spirit's

presence is evident these stories are

not just events from the past but are

alive and relevant today reminding us

that the holy spirit continues to work

wonders in our lives so today let's

explore 10 signs that show the holy

spirit's presence Among Us sign number

one transformation of character in our

lives change is inevitable like Seasons

shifting we too undergo changes both

inside and outside but when the Holy

Spirit is actively working within us

there's a particular kind of change a

special transformation that is unlike

any other as the Bible in Galatians 5:

22 to 23 explicitly States but the fruit

of the spirit is love joy peace

longsuffering

kindness goodness faithfulness

gentleness self-control these aren't

just words but transformative changes

their presence are an indication of a

heart deeply influenced by God's grace

and the Holy Spirit where whether you

are making reference to your own life or

the life of others these changes should

be present in a believer's character

it's as if a garden once dominated by

wild weeds suddenly flourishes with

colorful and fragrant blossoms consider

that this

transformation isn't always instant nor

is it always easy there will be days of

struggle of Doubt days of trying and

failing

so I am not here to tell you that your

walk with God is going to be perfect but

what's important is that in the midst of

these trials we persevere leaning on the

unwavering strength and grace of God for

it's not the absence of challenges that

defines our faith but our resilience and

Reliance on him while experiencing them

it's the holy spirit that nurtures us

gently tending to our souls guiding us

through those challenges ing moments

just as a Potter shapes clay the spirit

molds our character smoothing Out rough

edges and filling the cracks with

Christ's love over time our desires

shift from the worldly to the

Heavenly from pleasing ourselves to

pleasing God it's a journey from being

self-centered to being Christ centered

and it's truly one of the most beautiful

Adventures one can experience sign

number two desire to pray

prayer is like a heart song a sacred

Melody that we share with the Creator

yet there will be moments when our voice

falters when emotions Cloud our thoughts

and words Escape us it's in these silent

gaps these pauses that the Holy Spirit

steps in as Romans 8 verse

26 beautifully

States likewise the spirit also helps in

our

weaknesses for we do not know what we

should pray for as we ought but the

spirit himself makes intercession for us

with groanings which cannot be uttered

this is telling us how the spirit

becomes our voice translating our

heart's deepest yearnings into a

language only God understands it's like

having a friend who knows exactly what's

on your mind even when you can't find

the words to express it one of the

beauty of prayer is its Simplicity it

doesn't require grand gestures or

elequent words all it needs is a sincere

heart the Holy Spirit amplifies this

sincerity by turning our simple Whispers

into profound conversations with God he

becomes our partner in prayer guiding

our spirit and deepening our connection

with the almighty so when we kneel down

to pray we're never truly alone the

spirit is right there with us ensuring

that every sigh every tear every

unspoken word is heard felt and

cherished by God sign number three

conviction of sin we've all had moments

in our lives when we felt a tug at our

heart signaling that something we've

done wasn't right this deep sense of

awareness is not merely a feeling of

guilt it's the Holy Spirit working with

within heightening our sensitivity to

sin and driving our hearts towards

repentance look at what Jesus himself

stated in John 16 verse 8 and when he

has come he will convict the world of

sin and of righteousness and of judgment

we see this happening in the story of

King David and the prophet Nathan when

David strayed it was Nathan's gentle

rebuke inspired by God's spirit that

guided him back to righteousness the

Holy Spirit plays a similar role in our

lives offering gentle Corrections and

guiding us back when we drift but here's

the thing the challenge arises when some

of us Overlook the gentle nudges of the

holy spirit that has been urging us to

return to the right path over time if

ignored these sins can form habits or

strongholds in our lives that may become

challenging to break free from these

strongholds not only entangle us but

also complicate our lives even further

sign number

four understanding of scripture have you

ever read a scripture that you've seen

countless times before but suddenly it

speaks to you in a new and profound way

I can surely testify to this and I know

that this experience is not unique to me

that's the holy spirit's work making the

word of God come alive and making it

resonate deeply and personally with us

John

16:13 assures us however when he the

spirit of Truth has

come he will guide you into all

truth the Bible tells us about the

Ethiopian unic in Acts 8: 27 to

39 while reading from the book of Isaiah

the Ethiopian unic was approached by

Phillip without the spirit's Guidance

the unic struggled to understand the

scripture he read but with Philip's

Spirit Led

explanation the message became clear and

he was baptized as we delve into God's

word the spirit consistently sheds light

on scriptures revealing deeper truths

and making connection that we might have

missed on our own sign number five

empowerment for service imagine finding

a well of strength and ability within

you that you never knew existed that's

the transformative power of the Holy

Spirit equipping Believers with the

strength to serve witness and testify

for Christ acts 1 verse 8 says but you

shall receive power when the Holy Spirit

has come upon on you and you shall be

witnesses to me in Jerusalem and in all

Judea and Samaria and to the end of the

Earth think of the Apostle Peter before

the Holy Spirit came upon him he denied

Jesus out of fear but afterwards filled

with the spirit he stood in front of

thousands boldly proclaiming the gospel

likewise as the spirit Works within us

our god-given talents and spiritual

gifts not only become evident but are

also refined and utilized all for the

glory of God sign number six increased

compassion compassion is more than just

a fleeting sentiment it's an overflowing

of God's love in our hearts Romans 5:5

States now hope does not disappoint

because the love of God has been poured

out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who

was given to us this love transforms us

leading us to genuinely care for those

around us remember the Good Samaritan

his compassionate act towards a total

stranger showcased a heart touched by

Divine love yet it's essential to note

that sometimes other individuals may

also outwardly perform acts of kindness

without genuine compassion at the core

but true spiritual transformation is

marked not just by actions but by an

authentic love that stems from a deep

connection with God so there is a

difference as it relates to the Good

Samaritan in a similar

way the Holy Spirit stirs in us an

authentic concern aligning our hearts

with Jesus's profound command to love

God wholly and to extend that same love

to others under the holy spirit's

influence alongside this love for our

fellow humans there also arises a deep

genuine love for Jesus himself it's an

affection that is sincere going Beyond

mere ritual or

religion while drawing us closer to his

heart and his ways this

transformation is a testament to the

spirit's power to redirect our

affections and priorities anchoring them

firmly in Christ sign number seven

speaking in tongues on the day of

Pentecost a miraculous event occurred

Acts 2

verse4 tells us and they were all filled

with the Holy Spirit and began to speak

with other tongues as the spirit gave

them utterance this was evident in the

early church where Believers were

empowered by the spirit expressing their

faith in diverse yet unifying ways but

even

today this miraculous gift of speaking

in tongues is still present in the lives

of many Believers serving as a testament

to the spirit's active presence consider

this speaking in tongues is a

supernatural

sign showcasing the spirit's magnificent

work within us it's a Divine utterance

that allows our spirit to communicate

directly with God while not everyone may

experience this in the same way it

remains a genuine Testament to the

spirit's overflow within our lives

so if you ever doubt the spirit's

presence in your life due to your

experience differing from others

remember that it isn't about comparison

each of us have our own story embrace

your unique experience for it is genuine

and valid it is a testament to the

everpresent Overflow

of the spirit in your life interestingly

I can vividly recall my first experience

of speaking in tongues it occurred at

night right after I was emerging from a

dream

so these spiritual moments manifest in

their own perfect timing like many

Believers you can seek God's guidance

and request the gift of speaking in

tongues as a sign of the holy spirit's

presence be patient patient and avoid

comparing yourself with others remember

it's a gracious gift and a unique

experience all that's required of you is

to be openhearted and welcome it sign

number eight guidance in decision making

life is filled with Crossroads decisions

that can significantly shape our path

these decisions can sometimes mean the

difference between life and death

success uccess or failure seizing an

opportunity or missing it

but with the holy spirit's influence as

Believers we aren't left wandering in

the dark or to navigate these moments

alone as we tune in to the holy spirit's

Divine guidance we find Clarity even in

life's most complex moments Romans 8

verse 14 assures us for as many as are

LED by the spirit of God these are sons

of God so the holy spirit is our Compass

providing Divine Direction and wisdom

consider the story of Paul and Silas in

the book of

Acts when they were imprisoned for

preaching the gospel rather than falling

into despair they sang praises to God as

a result there was a miraculous

earthquake that opened

the prison doors their unwavering faith

and the guidance of the Holy Spirit not

only led to their physical freedom but

also to the jailer's spiritual salvation

therefore this kind of divine Direction

not only enlightens us with the truth or

points us to the right

path but also provides peace assuring us

that we're in alignment with God's will

sign number nine biblical sign signs and

wonders the Bible is not just a book of

past events it's a testament to God's

enduring power and the Wonders that come

through faith Mark 16: 17 to18 promises

and these signs will follow those who

believe in my name they will cast out

demons they will speak with new

tongues they will take up

serpents and if they drink anything

deadly it will by no means hurt them

they will lay hands on the sick and they

will recover such Divine demonstrations

aren't limited to Biblical times reflect

on the Apostle Paul's journey in Acts

once blinded on the road to

Damascus he later regained sight through

anas's prayer showcasing God's

miraculous power in today's world

Believers are still witnesses to and

instruments of God God's marvelous Works

proving the Timeless nature of his

promises and the everpresent power of

the Holy Spirit and sign number 10 peace

and faithfulness amidst the Whirlwind of

life's uncertainties and challenges

there exists a sanctuary of calm

available to every

believer Philippians 4 verse 7 tells us

and the peace of God which surpasses all

understanding will go guard your hearts

and Minds through Christ Jesus this

isn't a temporary feeling or a

short-lived Comfort it's a profound

enduring peace that anchors our souls

consider the Apostle Paul imprisoned and

bound yet his letters radiated with an

inexplicable peace even in Chains he

wrote words of encouragement and hope

revealing the Deep Well of peace that

was his through the Holy Spirit such

inner peace is not dictated by our

surroundings but it comes from the Holy

Spirit reminding us continually of God's

everlasting love and care also in a

world where people often change their

minds and don't always stay loyal the

holy spirit gives Believers a strong and

Lasting commitment to

faithfulness so if you're struggling

with staying

faithful you might want to seek the

guidance and strength of the Holy Spirit

to help you maintain your commitment to

your spiritual beliefs and values

consider that as a Believer if you are

unfaithful to others you are also being

unfaithful to God resist the devil and

he will flee from you the devil will

stick around if he finds that you're not

resisting in 2

Timothy 2:

13 the Bible reminds us if we are

faithless he remains faithful he cannot

deny himself the strong sense of

commitment or ability to stay faithful

isn't just something we do on our own

it's a Divine gift given to us think of

Stephen the first Christian martyr as

Stones rain down on him he gazed

heavenward and saw Jesus standing at the

right hand of God instead of anger or

fear Steven's heart overflowed with

faithfulness praying for his persecutors

such unwavering commitment to God's

teachings even in the face of dire

adversity is a testament to the spirit's

transformative power within guiding us

to hold fast to God's promises and live

out our faith courageously isn't it

comforting to

know that in our journey with God we are

not alone the Holy Spirit actively Works

within us nurturing our our growth

guiding our steps and instilling virtues

that reflect the heart of Christ let us

Embrace these signs with Open Hearts

trusting in God's plan and

purpose for our lives as we journey

forward let's remain steadfast leaning

into his unwavering love and grace with

the Holy Spirit by our side we can

confidently face tomorrow knowing we are

held guided and loved beyond measure

remember we are living in times where

many voices clamor for our attention but

there's one voice the spirit's gentle

whisper that can guide us through the

most turbulent of Storms and into the

calm of God's Embrace let us not merely

seek the signs but yearn for a deeper

intimate relationship with our creator

through the trans transformative power

of the Holy Spirit changing us to become

more like Jesus in that intimate

relationship we find true purpose peace

and the profound Joy of knowing we walk

hand in hand with the almighty
