are we living in the final days before

the return of Christ as signs of the

times unfold around us one question

echoes in the hearts of Believers and

Truth Seekers alike will Christ return

soon think about a world where the sun

sets painting the sky in Hues of orange

and

pink signaling the end of one day and

the beginning of

another this daily occurrence is not

just a visual Feast but a metaphor for

the profound changes and signs that

Herald significant

events in our spiritual

journey these changes are like the signs

that foretell the coming of our Lord and

Savior Jesus Christ

today I will guide you through an

exploration of eight signs that indicate

the near Nearness of Jesus's return this

journey is essential for those seeking

Revelation guidance and a profound

understanding of God's word I am also

going to pray a powerful prayer with you

in the mighty name of Jesus so watch

until the end and open your hearts to

receive the blessings of this

prayer as we stand at this pivotal

moment in history let's reflect on the

words of Jesus in Matthew

24:6 where he spoke of wars and rumors

of wars saying see that you are not

troubled for all these things must come

to pass but the end is not yet this

verse serves as a beacon guiding Us in

understanding the times and preparing

our hearts for his return now let us

explore eight signs that are prophesied

to be fulfilled before Christ returns

number

one the outpouring of the holy spirit

this outpouring of the holy spirit is a

pivotal sign of the end times acts 2:17

speaks of the last days saying and it

shall come to pass in the last days says

God that I will pour out of my spirit on

All

Flesh this prophecy is not merely a

statement of future events but a

testament to God's enduring commitment

to

humanity imagine a land scorched by the

Relentless Sun Yearning For

Rain the outpouring of the holy spirit

is similar to the first raindrops that

touched this parched Earth bringing

Rejuvenation and new life in our times

we are privileged to witness this

spiritual awakening the spirit's power

is increasingly manifesting through

spiritual gifts stirring Revival

movements and transforming lives this

Divine outpouring is not confined to a

select few but is generously given to

all who seek it the holy spirit is not

just a source of spiritual Revival it is

a source of empowerment for every

believer it equips us to serve with

passion to Bear witness with boldness

and to deepen our communion with God

this empowerment is a further

fulfillment of Jesus's promise in John

14 verse 26 where he assured us of the

helper the Holy Spirit whom the father

would send in his

name This Promise was not just for the

Disciples of old but extends to us today

empowering us for the work of the

Kingdom also the holy spirit's role is

pivotal in convicting the world of sin

righteousness and judgment as John 16:8

tells us and when he has come he will

convict the world of sin and of

righteousness and of

judgment so this conviction is essential

for guiding people towards repentance

and faith in Christ the spirit's work is

not of

condemnation but of loving correction

guiding us towards the truth of the

Gospel also the outpouring of the Holy

Spirit fills us with hope and

anticipation it offers us a preview of

The Coming age a glimpse of the kingdom

of God already at work among us this

outpouring is a reminder that God is

actively engaged in our world drawing

people to himself as we experience and

witness the outpouring of the holy

spirit let us be filled filled with hope

joy and A Renewed commitment to be

instruments of God's love and grace in a

world that yearns for his

Touch number two the restoration of

Israel and the conversion of the Jewish

people Romans

11: 25 to 26 speaks profoundly about the

eventual acceptance of Jesus as the

Messiah by the Jewish people it states

for I do not desire Brethren that you

should be ignorant of this mystery lest

you should be wise in your own opinion

that blindness in part has happened to

Israel until the fullness of the

Gentiles has come in and so all Israel

will be

saved the restoration of Israel and the

conversion of the Jewish people is a

significant prophetic event like a long-

awaited reunion in a great family story

it symbolizes the Fulfillment of God's

promises and the completion of his

Redemptive plan for both Jews and

Gentiles understand that this prophetic

event involving the restoration of

Israel and the conversion of the Jewish

people has been partially fulfilled

through Israel becoming a nation in

1948 which marks a significant milestone

in biblical prophecy the prophecy can be

seen in Ezekiel 37 particularly in

verses 21 to 22 where it is written thus

says the Lord God surely I will take the

children of Israel from among the

Nations wherever they have gone and will

gather them from every side and bring

them into their own land and I will make

them one nation in the land on the

mountains of Israel and one King shall

be king over them all they shall no

longer be two Nations nor shall they

ever be divided into two kingdoms

again so the reestablishment of Israel

as a nation in

1948 is a fulfillment of Prophecy

signifying a significant event in the

biblical prophetic

timeline this event is a reminder of

God's faithfulness and his ability to

bring about his plans despite seemingly

impossible

circumstances just as a gardener

nurtures a long dormant tree back to

life God will revive the hearts of his

chosen

people

now the conversion of the Jewish people

to Faith In Jesus as the Messiah will

not be just a historical or religious

event but it will also hold deep

spiritual significance for the entire

world it will represent the breaking

down of barriers and the unification of

all believers under one m

Messiah this prophetic fulfillment calls

for an attitude of humility and love

from the Gentiles rather than boasting

or feeling Superior we are to embrace

our Jewish brothers and sisters with

open arms recognizing that we are all

part of God's family the restoration of

Israel and the conversion of the Jewish

people is a Beacon of Hope and a

powerful Testament to the truth of

scripture it serves as an encouragement

to all believers to remain steadfast in

faith trusting in God's promises and his

perfect

timing my

friends the developments in Israel and

Jerusalem should remind us of The

Nearness of Christ's return as we

witness these events let us Lift Our

Eyes in

anticipation knowing that our Redemption

draws nearer with each passing day

number three the rising of false

prophets and spiritual

deception in Matthew 24: 11 we are

warned then many false prophets will

rise up and deceive

many this is a crucial sign of the times

we must heed we must watch out

vigilantly for the rise of false

prophets just as a ship's Captain must

navigate carefully to avoid treacherous

Waters

we too must discern the spiritual

landscape to identify those who mislead

and

deceive these false prophets often come

disguised as bearers of Truth they are

like wolves and sheep's clothing as

Jesus warned us in Matthew

7:15 the scripture says beware of false

prophets who come to you in sheep's

clothing but inwardly they are ravenous

wolves

therefore their teachings might seem

appealing but they lead away from the

truth of God's word the key to

identifying false prophets is by knowing

the true word of God like the bereans in

Acts 17: 10 to 11 who examined the

Scriptures Daily to see whether these

things were so we too must immerse

ourselves in the

Bible the prevalence of false prophets

is a call for us to deepen our

relationship with God it's in The Quiet

Moments of prayer and reflection that we

can truly discern his voice from among

the clamor of

falsehood my

friends let us not be

fearful but empowered by knowledge and

Faith the awareness of false prophets

should not lead us to despair but to a

firmer grasp of Truth and righteousness

furthermore 2 Thessalonians 2:3 warns us

let no one deceive you by any

means for that day will not come unless

the falling away comes first this

apostasy or falling away from the faith

is a critical sign of the end

times apostasy is like a tide slowly

receding before a great

tsunami it's a gradual yet sign ific an

departure from the foundational truths

of Christianity often replaced by more

modern or convenient

beliefs this spiritual deception often

comes in subtle forms it can be the

twisting of scripture to suit personal

desires traditions of men or the

dilution of biblical truths to align

with societal

Norms as Believers we must be anchored

in the word of God and be led by the the

Holy Spirit Discerning truth from

deception apostasy is often accompanied

by moral decline as Society moves away

from God's laws we witness an increase

in immorality and ethical Decay

fulfilling what was prophesied in 1

Timothy

4:1 about some departing from the faith

giving heed to deceiving spirits and

doctrines of

demons in the face of such deception we

must cling to our faith with even

greater Zeal our commitment to Christ

and his word should be

unshakable serving as a light in an Ever

darkening world the rise of

apostasy though disheartening should not

lead us to

despair but to action it is a call for

Revival for prayer and for a renewed

commitment to sharing the truth of the

Gospel with bold oldness and love number

four the increase of

lawlessness as noted in Matthew

24:12 and because lawlessness will

abound the love of many will grow

cold this sign is a sobering reminder of

the state of our world as we approach

the end times the increase in

lawlessness can be seen in various forms

around us it's like a creeping Vine

that slowly engulfs a once vibrant

Garden turning it into a place of Decay

and

neglect this lawlessness is not just a

rejection of societal laws but more

importantly a turning away from God's

Commandments it's a spiritual

lawlessness that manifests in various

moral and ethical Decay the idea of Love

growing cold is a direct consequ quence

of this

lawlessness as people turn away from

God's law their capacity for genuine

Selfless Love

diminishes it's like a light slowly

dimming losing its warmth and

brightness however in these challenging

times we are called to be beacons of

God's

love like the Good Samaritan in Luke 10:

30-37 our response to the rising

lawlessness should be one of compassion

and unwavering love let us therefore be

vigilant in our faith steadfast in our

love and unwavering in our commitment to

God's word in a world of growing

lawlessness our love and righteousness

shine

brightest number

five the increase of wars and

conflicts as Jesus for told in Matthew

24:6 the occurrence of wars and

conflicts is a sign of the times we live

in the scripture says and you will hear

of wars and rumors of wars see that you

are not troubled for all these things

must come to pass but the end is not yet

these events while distressing are

markers on the road mapap to Christ's

return look at the present War war

between Hamas and Israel happening

before our very eyes on October 7

20123 Hamas waged one of the deadliest

attacks on Jews since the

Holocaust my

friends the prevalence of wars and

rumors of wars in our world is not just

a political or social issue but it is

also a spiritual

signpost it reminds us that our world

world is in a state of turmoil and

longing for the peace that only Christ

can bring like the shifting Sands in a

desert these conflicts reshape the

landscape of our world and our

understanding of

Prophecy this proliferation of conflicts

serves as a call for believers to be

peacemakers as Jesus taught in the

Beatitudes we are to be lights in a

world darkened by conflict embodying the

message of reconciliation and hope found

in Christ in these times of unrest it's

vital to Anchor ourselves in prayer and

scripture as the psalmist wrote in Psalm

46:9 he makes Wars cease to the end of

the Earth he breaks the bow and cuts the

spear in two he burns The Chariot in the

fire this promise reassures US of God's

ultimate control over the Affairs of

Nations remember we must be vigilant we

must not be consumed by fear or despair

due to these events as Believers our

hope lies not in the stability of

worldly kingdoms but in the unshakable

kingdom of God

also these wars and conflicts remind us

of the urgency to spread the gospel as

the world groans under the weight of

strife and pain the message of Salvation

and the hope of Christ return becomes

even more crucial number six natural

disasters and signs from heaven in Luke

21:1 Jesus speaks of great

earthquakes famines and pestilences in

various places along with fearful sights

and great signs from Heaven these

natural disasters are significant

indicators of the times preceding his

return the increasing frequency and

intensity of natural disasters are like

alarm Bells awakening us to the reality

of the times we are living in they are

reminders that the creation itself

groans and suffers awaiting Redemption

as mentioned in Romans 8: 22 to

23 according to a new analysis of data

in

2023 at least 12,000

people 30% more than in

2022 lost their lives due to floods

wildfires Cyclones storms and landslides

globally European Union scientists also

said that

2023 would be the warmest year on record

AS Global mean temperature for the first

11 months of the year hit the highest

level on record above the average so

indeed 2023 was host to a variety of

disasters

some of them the worst their respective

countries have seen in years if not

decades though the year saw many of such

catastrophes earthquakes dominated the

top 10 in some cases taking thousands of

lives at

once and who knows what the coming year

or years will

bring these events call for a response

of compassion and

solidarity in the face of

disasters we are reminded of the

importance of loving our neighbors and

extending help to those in need it's an

opportunity to manifest the love of

Christ in practical ways natural

disasters also serve as a call to

repentance and spiritual awakening they

remind us of our human Frailty and the

need to seek God as Jesus said in Luke

13:5 unless you repent you will all

likewise perish emphasizing the urgency

of turning to God

in these times of uncertainty our faith

is our anchor as Believers we are

assured of God's presence and comfort

even in the midst of

turmoil this Faith enables us to be

beacons of Hope in a world shaken by

calamities number seven the global

spread of the Gospel in Matthew

24 verse

14 Jesus declares and this Gospel of the

Kingdom will be preached in all the

world as a witness to all the nations

and then the end will come this Global

evangelism is a definitive sign of the

times the widespread Declaration of the

Gospel is like a beacon shining across

the globe reaching every corner and

culture in an age where technology has

connected us more than ever this proph

prophecy is being fulfilled in

unprecedented ways from remote villages

to bustling cities the message of Christ

is being

shared

This Global evangelization effort calls

for active participation from every

believer we are all commissioned as in

Mark 16:1 15 to go into all the world

and preach the gospel to Every Creature

this is not just the task of

missionaries and pastors but of every

follower of Christ the spread of the

Gospel is often met with resistance and

persecution

yet just as the early church grew amidst

persecution these challenges often serve

to strengthen and spread the faith even

more as we partake in This Global

Mission it's essential to remember the

power of prayer and the guidance of the

holy spirit it's not by our might or

power but by the spirit of the Lord as

stated in Zechariah

4:6 also the Fulfillment of this

prophecy brings us closer to the return

of Christ each person reached and each

life transformed is a step closer to the

completion of this Great Commission and

the ushering in of Christ's return and

number eight the battle of

Armageddon Revelation

[Music]

16:16 introduces us to the concept of

Armageddon a term that has become

synonymous with the ultimate battle

between good and evil the verse says and

they gathered them together to the place

called in Hebrew

Armageddon this prophetic event is

depicted a pivotal confrontation in

human history the battle of Armageddon

represents the culmination of the agong

conflict between the forces of God and

the forces of evil it's like the final

act in a grand play where the tension

and conflict that have been building

throughout history reach their Peak this

battle is not just a physical

confrontation but also signifies a

spiritual Showdown it's a moment where

the spiritual realities behind the

physical world are fully unveiled and

the struggle between light and darkness

is brought to a decisive

conclusion as prophesied in Revelation

19 verses

11-6 Jesus returns as the triumphant

King and righteous Warrior leading the

armies of Heaven in a Victorious battle

against the forces of the Antichrist and

Satan this event also holds significant

importance for Israel the nation where

much of biblical prophecy and including

the final battle

converges according to scripture Israel

is Central to God's Endtime plans and

the Gathering at Armageddon in the

region of megiddo in Israel underscores

this pivotal role this event serves as a

sobering reminder of God's sovereignty

and Justice it underscores the reality

that evil in all its forms will

ultimately be defeated and that God's

righteous judgment will prevail for

believers the battle of Armageddon is a

call to steadfast Faith and

Hope it's an assurance that no matter

how chaotic or challenging the world may

seem God is in control and his ultimate

plan for Redemption and restoration will

be

fulfilled let us observe the world

around us particularly considering the

current conflict in

Israel it appears that if events are

aligning in a significant way my

friends Armageddon inspires a sense of

urgency for evangelism and

prayer understanding the reality of this

final battle should motivate us to share

the gospel with urgency and to live

lives that reflect the hope and truth of

our faith the events surrounding Israel

and

Armageddon remind us of the accuracy of

biblical prophecy and the certainty of

Christ

return urging us to be vigilant and

prepared our exploration of these eight

prophetic signs of Christ's return

serves as a powerful reminder of the

times we live in and our role as

Believers from the rise of conflicts and

natural disasters to the spread of the

gospel and the emergence of spiritual

challenges these signs call us to a

deeper Faith vigilance and active

participation in God's work the

restoration of

Israel and the ultimate battle of

Armageddon further underscore God's

Sovereign plan and the hope we hold in

Jesus's triumphant return

furthermore this message on the

prophetic signs of Christ's return is a

compelling call to action it invites us

not only to live with purpose hope and

anticipation

but also to secure our Salvation while

we can as we witness the unfolding of

these prophetic

events from Global upheavals to

spiritual Awakenings let us Embrace this

time as an opportunity to draw nearer to
