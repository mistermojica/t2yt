often Twist and Turn there lies a

profound truth simple yet profound you

will seek me and find me when you search

Divine Assurance an invitation to embark

on the most rewarding quest You'll Ever

undertake the to seek and find God the

promise of God's presence is not a

of those we

encounter God is there waiting to be

found in the multitude of life's

moments but remember seeking God is not

for God in the crowded rooms of our

minds and hearts it's about tuning our

ears to his voice amid the complexity of

life's demands it's about seeking his

will in our decisions his wisdom in our

confusion and his peace in our

turmoil and in this journey be reassured

that God's arm is not too short to save

nor his ear too dull to

hear he is closer than you think more

willing to reveal himself than you could

imagine just as the dawn dispels the

darkness so does God's presence

illuminate the shadows of uncertainty

and doubt as it is written in James

4:8 draw near to God and He will draw

near to you this is the beautiful

promise of seeking God

sirens busyness clutters the day and the

noise of the world often drowns out the

you will find him the rewards of

diligently seeking
